1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,009
so welcome back to this another lesson

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,629
and in this lesson we are going to look

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,670
at web logic concept in the previous

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,560
lesson I give you a high-level brief

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,230
overview of what topics we are going to

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,990
cover in this lesson so or in this

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,660
module so let's start with the first and

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,190
the most important about WebLogic

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,730
concept so what is a web logic server

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,980
it's nothing but an application server

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,990
which is Java EE 7 version of Java

12
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,769
compliant so application server is the

13
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,390
server on which you deploy the

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,510
application that has logic and this

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,510
application server helps you to run that

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,760
application running on the application

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,250
server so that's what is the WebLogic

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,250
server provide so what you do you deploy

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,340
or run and distribute Java based

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,690
applications on this application server

21
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,610
this application server access other

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,829
services like database to store the data

23
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,670
or messaging server to to send the

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,640
messages across between applications or

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,890
to connect to the external enterprise

26
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,630
systems like ebusiness suite or three

27
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,450
bill or peoplesoft or maybe salesforce

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,950
or s AP and shown so these that is the

29
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,220
WebLogic server WebLogic server various

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,200
exactly is used it's used pretty much

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,549
every Oracle product beeps ooh or Oh BAE

32
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:28,350
access manager Identity Manager

33
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,920
ebusiness suite Fusion Applications

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,320
Enterprise Manager 13c and so on so

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,759
you'll understand and appreciate if

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,470
you're looking for cloud Java cloud

37
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,540
services Sewer cloud services a

38
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,420
directory cloud service play from and

39
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,460
most of the pretty much swap cloud

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,759
service integration cloud service on

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,950
some platform you might have access to

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,170
the WebLogic some you may not have but

43
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,720
all underlying feeding using WebLogic

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,979
server now in 12c version there's a it

45
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,259
supports multi-tenancy which means what

46
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,820
do we what is multi-tenancy we'll cover

47
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,149
that in in a minute in the sub in the

48
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:07,770
respective lesson we have a dedicated

49
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,129
lesson for this so where one domain is

50
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,379
supporting multiple

51
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,159
what is tenant what is the domain we'll

52
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,480
look that in a minute

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,750
now WebLogic server now is also

54
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,450
supported on a docker container and if

55
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,799
you're big now if you don't know what is

56
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,470
it docker build may be worth googling

57
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,030
what is it docker solution

58
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,129
it's basically quickly and rapidly

59
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:35,400
deploy applications on and on a plate

60
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,260
form which is called a docker plate form

61
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,019
which is a additional software think of

62
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:42,329
it as a like a virtualization or virtual

63
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,129
server but it's not actually the virtual

64
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,720
server it's it's an in in compact

65
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,329
application in a docker container so Web

66
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,760
projects support that as well and other

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,459
competitors the lot of application

68
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,319
servers out in the market but these

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,609
three are top ones apache followed by

70
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:05,040
web logic and then IBM websphere these

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,299
are the three main players in

72
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:07,950
applications of a space you will see

73
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,939
either a patch a tomcat

74
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,090
you will either see IBM WebSphere or

75
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,459
Oracle WebLogic server there are plenty

76
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,400
more but these are more the most common

77
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,590
implementations of application server so

78
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,810
this is all about WebLogic server in

79
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,190
terms of if you look at the task

80
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,819
what a administrator does administrator

81
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,650
install the rom logic server they

82
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,629
configure domain they also you or a web

83
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:35,370
logic administrator will be deploying

84
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,489
the application given by the developers

85
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,280
you manage and migrate the domain from a

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,819
test environment to the product moment

87
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:46,620
integrate with identity access

88
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,479
management systems security system

89
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,049
third-party systems or like databases or

90
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,319
a business feed and so on troubleshoot

91
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,440
any issues find out the puff missed unit

92
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,900
some app users might say hey it's

93
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,819
running slow so that's where you look at

94
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,709
Java Virtual Machine garbage collections

95
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,310
or the struct threads and we'll cover

96
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,919
all these things on a high level in

97
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,280
coming lesson then monitor and manage

98
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,608
the WebLogic server configure and set up

99
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,048
high availability in disaster recovery

100
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:21,690
so these are all tasks of logic admin

101
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,460
and let's quickly look at what are the

102
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,260
tools available to you come handy so

103
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,870
there is a tool

104
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,360
WebLogic admin console we'll see and in

105
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,240
a minute about WebLogic console how does

106
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,340
it look like so it's a graphical user

107
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,600
interface to manage the entire domain

108
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,340
you another graphical user interface

109
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,280
which is Fusion Middleware control then

110
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,860
you have a command-line utility which is

111
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,290
called a web logic scripting tool or W

112
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,460
LST you also have restful api is exposed

113
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,930
by the WebLogic server through which you

114
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,030
can manage and deploy applications

115
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,090
you also have configuration wizard that

116
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,160
will be used to create or extend a

117
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,030
WebLogic domain

118
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,620
we'll see all these things in coming

119
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,020
lesson you also have Apache and

120
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,850
deployment tool which is from open

121
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,860
source to deploy applications on top of

122
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,000
a logic server

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,169
you also have SNMP agent which is a

124
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:17,020
simple network management or protocol to

125
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,330
and through which web logic has been

126
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,490
exposed you can you can do the hooks and

127
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,100
manage WebLogic server so these are

128
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,130
various tools on available for web logic

129
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,380
so in the next lesson we are going to

130
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,270
look at our head on to where we talk

131
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,419
about another most important component

132
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,099
or or concept which is called as

133
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:41,229
WebLogic domain but before we go to

134
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:42,970
WebLogic domain before we head on to the

135
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,430
next lesson let's quickly recap on what

136
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,639
we covered in this in this lesson so we

137
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,990
looked we started with the WebLogic

138
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,180
server I said it's an application server

139
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,970
it uses to run the applications and you

140
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,979
deploy application on top of that int

141
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:59,410
will see it supported multi-tenancy what

142
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,300
that multi-tenancy will we have going to

143
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,320
discuss in a minute

144
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,840
it also can be run or web logic can be

145
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,880
run in a docker based containers or

146
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,250
docker containers and other competitors

147
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,770
are IBM WebSphere and Apache Tomcat the

148
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,330
admin tasks these are some of the admin

149
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,010
tasks done by member logic

150
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,440
administrators you also have the tools

151
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,599
handy which are two graphical user

152
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:22,300
interfaces FM logic scripting tool

153
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,520
restful api is configuration with the

154
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,250
end and SNMP agent so head on to the

155
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,260
next lesson we will look at what exactly

156
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,630
is a admin server what is ever bloody

157
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,729
domain what is cluster what are the

158
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:35,830
resources and services and where are

159
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,860
these configurations store

160
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,419
I'll see you in next lesson
