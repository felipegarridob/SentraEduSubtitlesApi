00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,929
hi good morning in this presentation or

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,420
session we are going to show you how to

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,080
install Oracle WebLogic server there are

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,019
three parts or three steps you do in

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,670
order to install Oracle WebLogic server

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,350
in part one you install JDK or Java

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,170
development kit which will be used to

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,619
run your WebLogic server the next part

9
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,800
is you create you install oracle

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,650
weblogic server and third parties you

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,350
configure or you create WebLogic domain

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,280
and start your project server the first

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,600
step is installation of Oracle JDK so

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,550
I'm going to a staging directory where I

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,559
have JDK downloaded which is stage

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,980
Oracle JDK so if you notice here I have

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,489
two JDK software one is rpm file and

18
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,960
second a star file so you can either log

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,019
in as root and run this RPM when you run

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,689
this RPM and is going to install your

21
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:16,770
JDK under user java jdk 1.7 dot 51 so

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,570
this is jdk 1.7 update 51 so if you go

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,509
inside bin directory you will see I've

24
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,619
already installed JDK using RPM and c

25
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:34,920
java version 1.7 update 51 so one method

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,070
is you install RPM or using RPM - ivh

27
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,939
and the file name or RPM name other

28
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,100
method is you simply enter the JDK 7 the

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,899
way we are I'm going to show you again

30
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,329
here which is let's go back to trade ek

31
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:01,560
Oracle stage JDK and now on tau star

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:12,349
minus x VF jdk update 9 Linux 64-bit are

33
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,190
so it's unzipping the file now in under

34
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:21,819
folder jdk 1.7 and if i so this is my

35
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,599
jelly key home or you install jdk if i

36
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,730
go to the bin directory and then Java -

37
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,799
version I see Jenny give 1.7 update 9 so

38
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:41,019
to repeat when you install Oracle

39
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:42,970
WebLogic server first part you need to

40
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,269
do is you know to install JDK and there

41
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:48,400
are two ways to install JDK one is

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,609
installing install using rpm and second

43
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:55,000
is you simply enter the tar file into

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,040
the directory in which you would like to

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,890
install your jdk so i'm going to pick

46
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,010
the first method which is installation

47
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,620
using RPM which have already done in the

48
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,019
past using on my my jdk software

49
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:17,069
location a's user java jdk this is my

50
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,430
java home and inside that these the

51
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,069
files I have if I could have pinned and

52
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:26,560
I can run the Java version to check what

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,680
my Jake jdk server version is which is

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,760
1.7 update 51 in next step I'm going to

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,250
show you how to install Oracle WebLogic

56
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,639
server are in third step we are going to

57
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,340
create WebLogic server domain
