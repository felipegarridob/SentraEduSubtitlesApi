00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,280
welcome back to this another lesson and

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,380
in this lesson we will look at WebLogic

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,420
server installation and that's where the

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,069
real hands-on will start so we are

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,570
actually going to install the WebLogic

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,120
server so first of all there are two

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,980
type of installation in WebLogic server

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,490
you can either do a typical install or a

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,439
custom install and this is a screenshot

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,779
from an 11g our screens might differ

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,570
slightly between 11g and per se so right

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,300
now what I am Telling unless I specified

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,670
it's for 11g version of the blodgett now

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,439
as at the time of recording these videos

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,950
which is apparently 2018 the latest

16
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,739
version is 12c we are covering both 11g

17
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,719
as well as 2lc because lot of customers

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,700
are still on 11g lot of Fusion

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,559
Middleware customers are still on 11g of

20
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,260
logic so you can either install typical

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,260
which will install most of the component

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,170
or you can do a custom install and when

23
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,789
you select custom stall you can choose

24
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,730
which components you want to install

25
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,829
then if you're doing Fusion Middleware

26
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,359
installation like if you're doing it for

27
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,550
so ah Oh BIA web central access manager

28
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,220
identity manager and so on you typically

29
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,860
need to select or you select one with

30
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,290
coherence so when you download WebLogic

31
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,090
WebLogic comes a standalone route logic

32
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,430
or verb logic with coherence so make

33
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,380
sure you select web logic with covenants

34
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,869
and coherence is nothing but a data T of

35
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,290
layer which you will leverage the data

36
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,729
that you pull from the database you

37
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,400
store on the application tier under

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,790
coherence layer so this is too typical

39
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,100
to installation if you're doing custom

40
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,290
install you select cursor install and

41
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,590
you choose the component that you want

42
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,970
so you can pick up and then remove

43
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,430
things that you do not want as I said

44
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:41,939
earlier

45
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,740
coherence is mandatory if you're doing

46
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,020
for Fusion Middleware protect now so

47
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,720
that was about what kind of installation

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,810
type you can get then in which mode you

49
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,710
can install you can install you either

50
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,119
using graphical user interface or using

51
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,490
interactive both graphical user

52
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,409
interface or command line

53
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,848
so either interactive or graphical user

54
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,599
interface so so graphical user interface

55
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,590
is available both on

56
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,620
for Windows and for Linux or you can

57
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,470
also use console in console is again

58
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,480
interactive like graphical but it's a

59
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,670
text-based this is no GUI or graphical

60
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,080
user interface it's console it's a

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,269
text-based again available in both

62
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,170
Windows and Linux

63
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,989
so what you do all you do you say - mode

64
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,170
is equal to console then you can also do

65
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,959
a silent install and silent is non

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,260
interactive it's only available from a

67
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,060
package installer so what you do you say

68
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,220
- mode is equal to silent and then you

69
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,040
say silent underscore XML and then you

70
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,730
give path of the XML file now in 20 the

71
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,340
step is or the option or the parameter

72
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,200
for silent XML file is slightly

73
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,940
different or you have a response file in

74
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,849
11g so it will see this is I'm talking

75
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,120
about 11g you have an XML file in 12c

76
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,160
it's a response file the option is

77
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,930
slightly different but you have all

78
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,060
three more into LC and 11g the command

79
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,709
might be slightly different so you have

80
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,870
a graphical which is interactive and GUI

81
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,230
based

82
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,329
you have a console which is interactive

83
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,519
and text-based silent which is non

84
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,230
interactive which means you provide all

85
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,359
the details that you need to that logic

86
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,150
expect like a middle way home or

87
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,400
WebLogic home or whatever component to

88
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,190
select or way to install should we

89
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,139
automatically download patches from

90
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,120
Oracle or not all these you already

91
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,760
provided in an XML file and then you

92
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,340
pass this XML file with the installation

93
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,819
that's called as self install so how you

94
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,650
do silently store again we have a step

95
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,389
by step activity guide covered for you

96
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:50,280
so make sure wherever you're watching

97
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,859
this under that area you should have a

98
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,680
step by step activity guide so you pre

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,200
the XML file with the entry like this so

100
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,040
what it's saying

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,799
so some parameter some settings you can

102
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,970
change in this so you say select and say

103
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,540
oh this is my BA home which is my middle

104
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,819
way home this is the directory in which

105
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,280
I am going to install my WebLogic server

106
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,048
these are components or products I'm

107
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,149
selecting core components I'm selecting

108
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,700
this is my way of mine Java Virtual

109
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,190
Machine or JVM is installed this is my

110
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,400
node manager port number and and so on

111
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,479
so this is all about

112
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,569
the XML file that you select then use

113
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,449
silent install and you provide the XML

114
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:36,900
file path in as an option so some of the

115
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,169
good things which you must know so make

116
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,539
sure if you're installing any UNIX avoid

117
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,699
don't do it from root user and do it

118
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,560
from non root user maybe create a user

119
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,949
like Oracle or some other user then if

120
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:51,509
you are installing the WebLogic server

121
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:53,400
for fusion middleware product I only

122
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,710
said you need coherence and why you need

123
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,499
coherence because some or a lot of

124
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,930
fusion will middleware product uses

125
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,560
coherence for cluster communication so

126
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,930
like things like sois or oracle access

127
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,520
manager some components use coherence so

128
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,569
other thing to remember is very

129
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:14,310
installing you install WebLogic and you

130
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,379
install fusion will be a component make

131
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:18,659
sure you install using same user both

132
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:21,659
these components now the logic when you

133
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,699
install it expect jdk to be already

134
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,039
installed and make sure the JDK version

135
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,770
you are using or planning to use is

136
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,339
certified with the WebLogic server and

137
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:33,539
there's a certification metric that

138
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,819
comes if you can't find it reach of the

139
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,620
support drop an email to supported key

140
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,569
Tony Academy comm team will help you

141
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:41,189
depending on which version of the logic

142
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:43,469
you want or you can google it and you

143
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:46,259
will see that and such for Oracle

144
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,149
WebLogic server tells your 11g or

145
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,409
whatever words in you're looking for

146
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:53,060
certification metrics then by default

147
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,159
when WebLogic server installs it unzips

148
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,139
the entire SAR file into a temporary

149
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,060
area and then install from there and

150
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,270
create a staging area in under tamp now

151
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,860
sometimes you may not have enough temp

152
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,039
or the temp might be used by a

153
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,439
permission might not be usually you

154
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,939
should have all the right permission but

155
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,560
sometimes that same file might be

156
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,529
written by or not enough space so during

157
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:17,729
the station you can provide an option

158
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:21,960
like - D Java dot IO dot TMP di a-- and

159
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,789
you can specify any other temporary file

160
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:26,310
so that it's rather than using forward

161
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,979
slash then it's good to use some other

162
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,639
location so that's all about WebLogic

163
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,529
overview now in the next lesson be able

164
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,209
to look at how to install and configure

165
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:38,940
WebLogic server 12c let's look go and

166
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,220
quickly wrap up this lesson would be

167
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,100
so we looked at installation types we

168
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,230
looked at typical and custom then we

169
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,360
looked at custom installation in that

170
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,980
installation mode which is graphical

171
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,370
console and silent and in silent used to

172
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,920
create XML file and pass on this file we

173
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,110
also looked at good things to know now I

174
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,880
will see you next lesson will be look at

175
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,370
how to install and configure WebLogic

176
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,860
server 12c i'll see you in next lesson
