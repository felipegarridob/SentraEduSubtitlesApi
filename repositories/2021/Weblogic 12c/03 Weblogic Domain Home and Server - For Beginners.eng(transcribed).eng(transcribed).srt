1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,070
welcome back to this another lesson in

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,040
Oracle Fusion Middleware training and if

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,960
you're listening it at some other place

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,840
it's part of Oracle WebLogic server so

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,120
in this we are looking at domain room

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,219
and in this lesson be able to focus on

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,139
domain home earlier I mentioned about a

8
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,630
high level overview of domain and domain

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,330
whom is the top-level directory in which

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,029
you have domain specific directories so

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,939
things like admin server directory Java

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,369
database configuration JMS configuration

13
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,769
files the log files and everything we

14
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,260
discussed briefly in module 1 about

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,390
various homes and domain home was one of

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,879
them so when does this to mean home gets

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,610
created domain whom gets created when

18
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,829
you configure a WebLogic domain how do

19
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,570
you configure everyone you do mean you

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,219
configure it when you run config dot

21
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,379
asset you will see in this module how do

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,030
you run or create a membership domain

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,760
but domain whom contains top-level

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,199
directory in which you have all the

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,300
files and this is what you see in the

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,760
right hand side and that's a example or

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,280
or server where we have already

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,360
installed or files some look like so

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,400
this is still here this is my aura based

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,040
home or base domain or this is my domain

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,439
home inside that I have a bin folder

32
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,420
which is we been here

33
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,159
so bin folder will have all the

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,490
start-stop commands my servers folder

35
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,720
will have my admin and manage servers my

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,670
node manager folder will have node

37
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,009
manager depending on this impotency you

38
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,350
can decide and have node manager here or

39
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,860
some other place as well so if I go

40
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,650
under servers folder I will see a admin

41
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,570
server currently there's only admin

42
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,360
server started so these servers will get

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,070
created a folder servers will get

44
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,659
created when you start the server's

45
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,780
first time so I've only started admin

46
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,700
server in this domain and hence you see

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,219
admin folder within admin folder or

48
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,570
within the server folder I have cached

49
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,850
data data log and security we'll cover

50
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,369
that in a minute later then you have

51
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,070
config folder within domain whom the

52
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,570
config folder will have configuration

53
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,669
this config file folder I said earlier

54
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,619
that config dot XML this will have all

55
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,480
the configuration for entire domain you

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,730
can open this configuration

57
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,830
I'll tell what all things are configured

58
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,049
in this domain

59
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,879
you also have within config folder you

60
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,760
have GD BC folder and in JDBC folder you

61
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,620
have the Java database connectivity

62
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,540
final configuration file for the

63
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,849
database connectivity we'll see that in

64
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,250
a minute the bin folder will have all

65
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,959
the start-stop so you have start

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,599
WebLogic got SH to start the admin

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,970
server you have stopped WebLogic that sh

68
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,980
to stop the WebLogic server then you

69
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,420
have similarly start instead of node

70
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,549
managers start and stop the manage

71
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:44,900
servers as well so we will see all these

72
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,650
things what all our start/stop admin

73
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,069
server and manage servers or node

74
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:54,470
manager so this is all about a domain

75
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,530
home then I said there is a server and I

76
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,730
told you that there are two type of

77
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,650
servers admin server and manage server

78
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,120
we'll go a little bit deep into what

79
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,650
this administer our manage servers are

80
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,739
and how does they look like so this is a

81
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:08,480
screenshot about from a graphical user

82
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,220
interface which I call Oracle WebLogic

83
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,390
administration console of a logic

84
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,120
console and once you configure the

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,859
domain and once you start the admin

86
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:20,690
server you will be able to login and

87
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,190
access this console we are going to

88
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,180
cover that in a minute

89
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,190
or in subsequent lessons so when you

90
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,079
login on left hand side you explain this

91
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,120
and mom and you see servers and under

92
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,919
servers you see right hand side there's

93
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,450
something called as admin server and

94
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,730
other servers rest all are called as

95
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,919
manage servers so and means our first

96
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,500
one and only and the manage servers so

97
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,389
that's about servers so what is server

98
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,819
server of two type which is nothing but

99
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,980
1 is of admin server and just all our

100
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,340
manage servers these servers are used to

101
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,620
host the applications and resources like

102
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,019
what web archive er enterprise archive

103
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:00,349
czar Java archive JDBC to connect to the

104
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:03,620
database JMS to message exchange between

105
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,000
applications so that for application now

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,669
each server will have its own JVM and

107
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:13,190
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine

108
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,560
I repeat JVM stands for Java Virtual

109
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,750
Machine the Java Virtual Machine will

110
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,789
have some memory beginning memory in

111
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:21,769
which the code is being executed Java

112
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,909
code is being executed then it is a new

113
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:27,320
concept in 12c which is

114
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,330
dynamic servers servers which are

115
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,880
automatically being spent or spawn or

116
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,860
created automatically based on the

117
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,230
configuration as the load increases you

118
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,840
can automatically scale up the services

119
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,930
in 12c we'll see that in dynamic servers

120
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,420
in a minute so this is how the geo

121
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,010
virtual machine looked like so I said

122
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,690
it's nothing but a Java Virtual Machine

123
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,030
this is how the Java Virtual Machine

124
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,700
looked like what do you see you do PS

125
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,120
minus EF and grep for Java on the UNIX

126
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,520
machine so if I'm doing connecting to

127
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,210
the server and I say PS and then us and

128
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,680
then pipe and then grab minus I and Java

129
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,930
and if I run that command I is going to

130
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,820
give me if my Java processes are running

131
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,160
it's going to give me some output and

132
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,910
here I get output so what it's saying

133
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,910
it's saying oh this is a JDK I'm using

134
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,900
or Java development kit 1.7 it's a

135
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,200
server it's starting with memory X and s

136
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,410
means small memory footprint one gig it

137
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,120
can grow up to two gig and name of this

138
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,100
web server is over m and score server

139
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,930
and there are some other properties of

140
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,870
this server so the JVM is this

141
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,220
particular process which is running

142
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,020
under the process ID two six eight nine

143
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,390
nine is the java virtual machine in

144
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,830
which the code is going to be executed

145
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,900
so this is about a java virtual machine

146
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,750
each server which either admin server a

147
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,060
managed server and on node - server will

148
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,560
have its own JVM

149
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,690
they will have its own memory sizes they

150
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,410
will have its own pump size and max pump

151
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,750
size again we'll cover that when these

152
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,760
pump size and maximum size are covered

153
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
in the blonic so if you're part of the

154
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,940
project weenie this should be somewhere

155
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,710
in the craning if you're listening this

156
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,470
in the project you should see high

157
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,460
performance tuning and that's when we

158
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,750
have trouble to cover Java Virtual

159
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,370
Machine in detail we'll go deep into

160
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,470
that how do you tools what tools you

161
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,540
used to tune that java virtual machine

162
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,460
how do you find out the garbage

163
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,840
collection and everything so that's

164
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,820
about java virtual machine so as i said

165
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,260
head on to the next lesson we'll look at

166
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,060
and good deep into this admin server in

167
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,160
- server and we'll also look at how

168
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,050
admin server in - ever talk to each

169
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,950
other and

170
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,480
what is something called as managed

171
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,030
service independence or MSI mode and

172
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,490
we'll also look at clusters and dynamic

173
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,800
clusters which are introduced into NZ so

174
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,780
handle to the next lesson but for now

175
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,530
let me do a quick recap on this I said a

176
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,540
domain whom or domain is nothing but or

177
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,280
domain whom gets created when you

178
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,350
configure a domain and it has top-level

179
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,970
directory in which you have all the

180
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,310
other configuration files or log files

181
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,300
or start-stop files so that's a domain

182
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,490
you your servers which are of admin

183
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,310
server and a managed server the servers

184
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,990
each server represents a Java Virtual

185
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,140
Machine these servers where you host

186
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,370
