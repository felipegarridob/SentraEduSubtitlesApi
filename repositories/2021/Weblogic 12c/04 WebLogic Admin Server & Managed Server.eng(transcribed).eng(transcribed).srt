1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,399
so welcome back to this another lesson

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,899
and in this lesson we are going a little

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,850
bit deep into admin and manage servers

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,099
earlier we looked at obvious I said

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,080
there is a server of to type admin and

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,090
manage servers we took we have it

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,580
briefly touched on Java Virtual Machine

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,859
or JVM and now let's look at what is

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,410
admin server so admin server in a domain

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,930
there can be only one and always one

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,119
admin server and there is a one-to-one

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,340
relationship between domain and admin

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,590
server the admin server will always be

14
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,199
tied to that domain so admin server is a

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,480
server that is used to manage a domain

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,910
if you need to make any modifications it

17
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,989
is done through admin server so if you

18
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,030
need to manage any resources or other

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,070
servers like manage servers that all

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,200
done through admin server and if

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,730
configuration changes will done through

22
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,649
admin server so admin server is always

23
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,989
tied to the same many servers admin

24
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,739
server can across domains

25
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:59,399
similarly each domain can only have one

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,230
admin server and it can't connect to any

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,379
other admin server it can only connect

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,570
to its own admin server a domain can

29
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,820
only connect to its own admin server so

30
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,970
it's used to manage a domain it there

31
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,909
will be only one and only one admin

32
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:15,360
server

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,520
it's a singleton service which means you

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,590
can't run it in active active cluster

35
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,360
like we do in manage server will go deep

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,340
into this clustering and single done

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,840
service when we look at high

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,790
availability for now as if it's a single

39
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,860
internal service which means it can run

40
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,420
on at any given point in time on only on

41
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,189
one server you can migrate from one

42
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,939
server to another server however only

43
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,500
active at any one point in one server

44
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,250
other might be down out passive it can

45
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,479
only spend or manage one domain and

46
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:50,250
technically you can deploy a service on

47
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,950
top of our application on top of it

48
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,560
admin server but it's highly recommended

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,960
not to deploy in product production or

50
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,380
in normal deployment of void deploying

51
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,020
application on top of admin server

52
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,759
because it's a singleton service also

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,979
the primary purpose of this admin server

54
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,200
is to start or host the management part

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,330
then you have a managed server it's

56
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,280
similar to admin server but the role of

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,410
managed server is to run the

58
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,599
applications or host applications you

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,480
can have 0 to n minus servers then it's

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,879
independent to other servers other

61
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,069
servers or other manage servers unless

62
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:30,660
they are part of cluster which means

63
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,940
they can run independent to each other

64
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,830
other servers they can talk they can

65
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,480
independently run manage servers with

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,209
independent to other manage servers and

67
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:43,860
applications are deployed so let's

68
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,420
suppose you deploying a so application

69
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,330
or obiee application or Identity Manager

70
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,160
application access manager application

71
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,040
or for that reason Oracle management

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,910
server for DBS or or any fusion

73
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,980
applications they will be deployed and

74
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,920
running its own manage servers so how

75
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,630
admin and manage servers are related to

76
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,110
each other

77
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,120
so what happens is admin server will

78
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,090
have all the configurations however

79
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,340
managed server will also maintain a

80
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,769
replica of that sub configuration in its

81
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:20,130
own repository so each managed server

82
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,319
will have a local copy which it pulls

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,690
out down from the admin server and every

84
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,590
time it starts and for some reason if it

85
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,730
can't access the admin server at the

86
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,380
start of the managed server it will use

87
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,530
its local copy which means only for the

88
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,600
first time in the life cycle so when you

89
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,100
create a managed server after that when

90
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,440
you start only that time first time the

91
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,030
admin server should be up and running

92
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,010
because it needs to collect or retrieve

93
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,600
all the files from the admin server and

94
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,049
store it in so own local repository so

95
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:00,060
that's called as first time only for for

96
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,040
starting of manage servers the admin

97
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,319
server should be up and running after

98
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,120
that it will use if admin server is not

99
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,790
up and after it start up admin server

100
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,709
can go down and manage server will

101
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,349
continue to run its own on its own it

102
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,120
doesn't need an admin server after the

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,060
startup and later also if you let's

104
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,560
suppose you shut down and in admin

105
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,659
server is not available next time you

106
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:23,370
can still next time you can start it

107
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,650
means a many server without an admin

108
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,580
server

109
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,379
and that is called as managed server

110
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,710
independence or MSI mode in blahblah

111
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,669
jerk MSI where a managed server can be

112
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:37,919
managed or started independent to the

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,830
admin server so let's suppose you've

114
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,719
started the admins a managed server

115
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:45,870
without an admin server and some

116
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,550
configurations of chains with the admin

117
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,530
server which many server is not yet

118
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,860
aware of and then what I will happen the

119
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,539
minute you start the admin server admin

120
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,520
server will again push those changes

121
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,800
onto the managed server if it's related

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,520
to add manage server or next time cycle

123
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,560
of manage server manager will pull these

124
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,270
changes from the admin server so this is

125
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,659
called as manage server independence so

126
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,039
just to do a quick recap you have an

127
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:15,780
admin server you have a managed server

128
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,060
and admin server is for administration

129
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,860
purpose managed server is where the

130
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,029
applications are learned

131
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,219
then the managed server and admits of

132
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,259
are related to each of them they talk to

133
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,810
each other through a concept called or a

134
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,409
utility called node manager for starting

135
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:33,210
stopping only guys I repeat I starting

136
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,340
stopping that - only from console so

137
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,960
I'll pop that while I'll cover those

138
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,690
things in little bit later however admin

139
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,190
server can talk directly to the managed

140
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,960
server and but many server can also

141
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,360
manage itself without an admin server

142
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,930
after after once first time startup

143
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,979
however you wouldn't be able to make any

144
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,199
changes you can start stop and run the

145
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,069
application on top of a managed server

146
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,870
independent to the admin server it even

147
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,879
if while running let's suppose if you

148
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,500
have so application which is deployed in

149
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,050
many server admin server goes down only

150
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,029
you won't be able to change the

151
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:10,500
configuration you won't be able to come

152
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,659
change any configuration however your

153
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:14,339
users will continue to run your their

154
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,379
applications there will be no impact on

155
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,020
the end users because managed server is

156
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,339
still enough up and running

157
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,580
that's called as - our independence mode

158
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,960
so headed to the next lesson we will

159
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,469
look at clusters in 11g and new feature

160
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:30,719
or infancy which is called as dynamic

161
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:33,449
clusters which is used for elasticity or

162
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:37,770
automatic upscaling of servers will also

163
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,599
look at dynamic clusters server

164
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,420
templates

165
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,610
and data sources in the next lessons

166
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,020
hydral to the next lesson way we cover

167
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,250
clusters and dynamic clusters and

168
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,400
dynamic servers in WebLogic 12c as well

169
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,820
as some component in 11g so i'll see you

170
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,409
in next lesson
