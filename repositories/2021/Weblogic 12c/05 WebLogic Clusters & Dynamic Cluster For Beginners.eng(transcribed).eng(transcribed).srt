1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,829
so welcome back to this another lesson

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:03,210
and in this lesson we are going to look

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,700
at clusters and dynamic cluster briefly

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,290
in the previous lesson we looked at

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,389
servers will be looked at admin server

6
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:12,269
and managed server so let's look at what

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,890
does cluster represents so cluster is

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,490
nothing but a logical collection of or

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,070
collection or group of servers running

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,090
simultaneously and working together and

11
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:31,859
acting as a single or or acting as a one

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,440
server from a clients point of view I

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,290
repeat one more time cluster is nothing

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,620
but a collection of servers running as a

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,780
single unit from a client point of view

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,140
and which has more or less similar

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,450
configuration and similar applications

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,969
deployed so that if one much managed

19
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,160
server goes down another managed server

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,489
in the cluster can transparently

21
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,620
failover or sessions data from one

22
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,750
server to another and and for client a

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,969
they will never notice what happened or

24
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,060
if anything failed so cluster will help

25
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,880
in high availability or also in

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
scalability so let's suppose you have a

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,320
lot of load on a one application you can

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,540
put that application into cluster with

29
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,880
multiple servers all acting as one

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,119
single unit from a client point of view

31
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,420
for scalability or high availability so

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,960
so so server is nothing but a collection

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,930
of servers or cluster is nothing but

34
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,729
collection of servers running

35
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,479
simultaneously and acting as a single

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,210
unit from client point of view so you

37
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,320
can make changes to a cluster or a

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,990
member of a cluster by saying change

39
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,960
this configuration and say update this

40
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,450
configuration on all the cluster member

41
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,829
so either let's suppose you want to

42
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,710
deploy an application on a managed

43
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,689
server so rather than deploying on a

44
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,700
individual many servers you say deploy

45
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,979
on the cluster and all the members that

46
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,020
are part of that cluster will have that

47
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,209
application deployed so that's another

48
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,569
property of cluster so cluster is

49
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,680
nothing but collection of

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,019
- or more - servers technically you can

51
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,819
have a cluster with one - server only

52
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,879
but you might have more many servers but

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,860
having one cluster with one - server

54
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,590
doesn't give you benefit of high

55
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,739
availability or scalability but

56
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,329
technically even clerkly the cluster

57
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:34,980
with one managed service only so the

58
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,989
cluster members which are nothing but a

59
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,489
manage servers they can be on the same

60
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,019
machine or different machines and

61
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:42,000
there's a cluster communication which

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,189
could be unicast and multicast we'll see

63
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,139
that what is unicast and multicast when

64
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,329
we look at a high availability in its

65
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:50,159
dedicated module we'll see this cluster

66
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,840
communication we'll see the differences

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,920
between these two so that's cluster so

68
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,269
what you see in the diagram on the right

69
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,700
hand side is nothing but you have a

70
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,680
admin server which is on left hand side

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,370
and you have 4 on top and 4 on bottom

72
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,290
you have cluster 1 and cluster shows in

73
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,700
this domain you have one admin server

74
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,359
you have 8 manage servers for many

75
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:17,430
servers in cluster 1 and 4 - servers in

76
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,819
cluster - and the members within cluster

77
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,940
can can talk to each other using either

78
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,299
something called as unicast or multicast

79
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,340
the way the disputes so that's a cluster

80
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,159
then in Qin see there's a new concept

81
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,099
called dynamic cluster and dynamic

82
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,099
cluster is nothing but a cluster that

83
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,579
contains one or more dynamic servers I

84
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,829
repeat it's only in 12c it's not

85
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,650
available in 11g integration 12c dynamic

86
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,599
cluster is nothing but a cluster that

87
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,569
has one or more dynamic servers that

88
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,099
bring to the point what is dynamic

89
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,280
server we'll cover that in a minute

90
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,810
so in a dynamic cluster the servers are

91
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,540
scaled up automatically as the

92
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,319
application demands so I repeat the

93
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,419
servers in a dynamic cluster will

94
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,840
automatically scale up or add themselves

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,250
so that means when you're defining a

96
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,380
dynamic cluster you are saying this is

97
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,529
my minimum number of servers and it can

98
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,279
grow up to 12 15 18 20 many servers so

99
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,110
if your application requires right now -

100
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,900
it will be - if

101
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,610
your application later has load

102
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,669
increases you can those members or their

103
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:33,680
servers in the cluster in a dynamic

104
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,660
cluster can automatically increase based

105
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,699
on the configuration in the Newton so

106
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,500
that means it needs a port number it

107
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,080
needs some default mechanism to identify

108
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,960
what port number to run what JVM size to

109
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,630
run what name we should keep all those

110
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,789
things we can do so dynamic clusters

111
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,210
that's a property of dynamic cluster it

112
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,070
uses something called a server template

113
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,380
to create the dynamic servers so

114
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,330
template is nothing but a layer or or or

115
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,449
or a set of configurations that used to

116
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,820
create a dynamic server and dynamic

117
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,990
servers come or dynamic couple of

118
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,840
dynamic servers will make a cluster or a

119
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,300
dynamic cluster so server template uses

120
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,710
defines a configuration that will be

121
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,910
used when we create a dynamic server so

122
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,410
this is one example of that so you

123
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,570
that's a dynamic cluster so I didn't say

124
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,340
you creating a cluster from a bridging

125
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,520
console and you see you with a do and a

126
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,380
static cluster which is first and second

127
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,020
option right inside on the circle which

128
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,270
is dynamic cluster when you create the

129
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,800
dynamic cluster you will get a screen

130
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,389
like on one on the left hand side that

131
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:46,430
says what is the size of the dynamic

132
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,990
cluster size between two servers right

133
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,880
now it can grow up to eight service or

134
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,010
what is the name of the manager we will

135
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,320
say dynamic cluster zero one and then -

136
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,169
and it will say one two three four or

137
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,870
name

138
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,789
so that's name of the manage servers or

139
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,229
dynamic servers in the cluster then

140
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,370
dynamic servers are nothing but a

141
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,490
servers that gets created by using the

142
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,060
server template by dynamic cluster so

143
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,130
dynamic cluster will tell based on the

144
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,530
load will dictate hit create a more -

145
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,750
more many servers but out of type

146
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,240
dynamic which using a template which

147
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,979
will automatically may be created and

148
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,289
what do you see you could if the

149
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,389
application can create or the domain can

150
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:34,250
create automatically or you as an

151
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,930
administrator can go and create these

152
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,500
dynamic servers but they'll be using a

153
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,610
template or

154
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,449
our template so what what do you see in

155
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:45,889
the console have already created a

156
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,169
dynamic cluster and that in the dynamic

157
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:50,960
cluster we created a two servers or

158
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,460
dynamic servers so cluster when you

159
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,379
create a cluster and when you define it

160
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:55,610
at that time it will create these

161
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,800
dynamic servers so what you see type

162
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,680
dynamic that means there is a these

163
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,289
there in this domain there as one admin

164
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,000
server in to many servers and these two

165
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,199
more many servers are dynamic servers

166
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,840
created by a dynamic cluster and then

167
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,400
you have a server template I said

168
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,830
earlier just now that for this dynamic

169
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,569
service to be created it needs a

170
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,569
template from using Mita to create this

171
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,849
dynamic servers so templates are nothing

172
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:25,689
but it enables to define a common

173
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:28,310
non-default attribute which means oh

174
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,529
what should be the name so in this case

175
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,779
if the previous example if you take the

176
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:35,659
known the non default attribute in this

177
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:38,240
case is prefix server name prefix which

178
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,960
is dynamic cluster 0 1 - it will dictate

179
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,919
that this is how so it enables to define

180
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,349
a common non-default attribute which

181
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:53,050
could be 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and so on then

182
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,759
server templates are used to create the

183
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,400
dynamic clusters the members in the

184
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,979
dynamic cluster will be using or dynamic

185
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,659
cluster will be using a server template

186
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,839
to create a dynamic server and you can

187
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,360
create your own templates by using going

188
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,400
to the WebLogic console and the clusters

189
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,870
you can say server template and you can

190
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,789
create new template if you don't create

191
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:15,800
any template it will otherwise use the

192
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,240
default template in order to create

193
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,419
these dynamic servers so that's all

194
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:23,629
about the servers clusters we'll look at

195
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,629
the other topics like GD b c and j ms g

196
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:28,460
DB c stands for Java database

197
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,529
connectivity if an application needs to

198
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,510
talk to the database it will use JDBC

199
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,669
and there are three different type of

200
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,919
JDBC generate griddling and multi data

201
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,110
source we will see that and JMS in the

202
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,779
next lesson so let me do it quickly cap

203
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,429
in this lesson we looked at the cluster

204
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,560
which is nothing but collection of two

205
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,199
or more servers on which you have an

206
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,959
application deployed on both the servers

207
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,120
and from time point of view they are

208
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,540
acting as a single unit

209
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,740
cluster numbers can be a different host

210
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,770
or same host and they communicate of

211
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,690
members in the cluster communicate to

212
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,700
each other using something called as

213
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,250
either a unicast or multicast what are

214
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,360
these be able to look at in high

215
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,160
availability then there's a dynamic

216
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,580
cluster which is nothing but clustered

217
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,560
that gets created that have members

218
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,450
automatically grow or shrink based on

219
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,410
the load and those members are called as

220
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,820
dynamic servers because they are

221
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,560
dynamically created by the dynamic

222
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,220
cluster and they use or being created

223
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,710
using a server template and you can

224
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,540
define your own server template so

225
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,970
that's about clusters in this let's

226
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,830
handle to the next way we look at GD BC

227
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:41,650
and Jamie's I'll see you in next lesson
