1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,300
so welcome back to this another lesson

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,299
in module WebLogic server and in this

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,649
lesson we are going to look at node

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,070
manager and machine but before I tell

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,620
road manager machine quickly what we did

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,509
in previous lesson was data source and

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,240
we looked at JMS and now let's look at

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,660
node manager so node manager is nothing

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,830
but a java process running on each host

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,730
or a machine where WebLogic server is

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,270
running so I repeat one more time node

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,570
manager is a Java process which is

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,870
running or which usually run on a server

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,629
where WebLogic admin or manage servers

15
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,460
or any type of web logic servers are

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,000
running what node manager helps known

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,329
manager helps in remotely or in in help

18
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,449
in enabling or works for or helps in

19
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,809
starting or stopping services remotely

20
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,799
and services I mean is the server's

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,500
managed server or admin server and for

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,650
some reason if server crashes abnormally

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,930
node manager if it started by node

24
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,689
manager then get go and restart that

25
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,950
server again it must be always if you

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,030
want a server to be started using the

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,240
logic console or through web logic

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,939
scripting tool then node manager must be

29
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,799
always running there are different ways

30
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,450
to start the services we will see that

31
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,040
when we look at the start and stop and

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,740
one of them is using start WebLogic dot

33
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,409
SH or start manage WebLogic dot SH which

34
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,310
is shell scripts or you can also start

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,590
them from a manage servers you can start

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,270
them from a graphical console which is

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,040
WebLogic admins web ready console or you

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,380
can also start them both admin server as

39
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,689
well as manage server from the blodgett

40
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,250
scripting tool and if you have to do

41
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,409
that using the basic scripting tool then

42
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,409
or from a web logic console then node

43
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,909
manager must be running and it's only

44
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,508
used to manage and maintain configure

45
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,750
maintain or the server life cycle to

46
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,220
start and stop services

47
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,420
so having said that you can run your

48
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,849
servers without node manager as well so

49
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:23,920
you can have node manager all down and

50
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,400
you can run servers independently

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,250
without any need of node manager

52
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,780
similarly let's suppose you have started

53
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,760
a server using a node manager which is

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,470
why a logic controller WebLogic

55
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,420
scripting tool and then your new manager

56
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,370
goes down your server will still

57
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,870
continue to run now the way you deployed

58
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,480
newton manager you can have multiple

59
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,400
deployment topology you can have one

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,030
node manager associated with multiple

61
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,579
domains in a sir on on that physical

62
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:57,310
host I repeat one more time you can have

63
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,160
one node manager serving multiple

64
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,040
different domains which means node

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,769
manager is not specific to or not a part

66
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,110
of just any domain node manager can be

67
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,280
associated with multiple domains on a

68
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,030
host or you can deploy it in a way

69
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,730
saying each domain will have one node

70
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,859
manager so it's all down to what you

71
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:22,750
feel comfortable with and that's what

72
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,660
you can set up so if I know so what you

73
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,450
see in the diagram let's suppose I have

74
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,150
a two machines let's suppose two

75
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,010
different machines and the yellow

76
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,440
represents into a man is a node manager

77
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,799
and the red represents a admin server

78
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,510
now I have one more machine which is on

79
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,630
the right-hand side where you have where

80
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,220
you have a manís server which is

81
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,049
currently down which is represented by

82
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,450
got it now dotted line and you want to

83
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,889
start that managed server which is

84
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:58,090
represented by the dotted line on the

85
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,919
upper of our image so what you're going

86
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,930
to do you are going to tell your going

87
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,459
to issue a command from the WebLogic

88
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,799
console and say go and start the server

89
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,620
- server where this managed server is

90
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,950
deployed and sitting on another machine

91
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,760
so they'll be association of managed

92
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,459
server with a node manager let me repeat

93
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,519
one more time will be association of a

94
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,599
manager work with a node manager and the

95
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,540
association happens by the Machine the

96
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,890
see in the next slide so note admin

97
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,560
server will see that this node manager

98
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,980
is running or associated with which

99
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,830
machine and on that machine what what

100
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,580
node manager is configured so admin

101
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,290
server will issue a command to the node

102
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,720
manager node manager will then in turn

103
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,790
go and start this managed server and

104
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,670
that's how this process works so let me

105
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,920
first let's see first of all where this

106
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,980
configuration are on the server or what

107
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,020
are the associated configurations with

108
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,300
respect to the node manager so I'm

109
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,460
currently so the node manager by default

110
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,890
for 11g I am going to focus only on 11g

111
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,200
and then picking up to NC is simple and

112
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,030
12c slightly there is a slight change in

113
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,950
the way node manager is configured or

114
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,120
done but the concept remains same so the

115
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,370
the configuration for node manager will

116
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,290
be all the configuration file log file

117
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,390
everything will be under the logic

118
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,240
server home under the directory or file

119
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,910
called servers and in that you will have

120
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,780
bin folder and you have a script called

121
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,780
start node manager dot SH and that will

122
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,210
start other node manager there's no

123
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,520
script to stop the node manager you have

124
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,280
to kill in order to stop the new manager

125
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,700
process in 11g princey there is a script

126
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,550
but I will focus on 11 GS n so in 11g

127
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,410
there is no process or there's no script

128
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,090
to stop the node manager you have to

129
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,860
kill it once you have started the loan

130
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,080
manager all the configurations and

131
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,670
everything will be under the common

132
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,340
folder so you go under M but common not

133
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,860
common Oracle home it's under WebLogic

134
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,410
home common folder and within common

135
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,020
folder you will go into the node manager

136
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,420
folder and here you will have all the

137
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,550
files like node manager log files or

138
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,770
anything any errors everything will be

139
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,360
going to node manager dot log file

140
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,430
they'll be a node manager dot properties

141
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,590
file so when the node method starts it

142
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,510
will use this node manager properties

143
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,440
dot file to start the node manager and

144
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,380
you can change this file here node

145
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,690
manager does properties file so it will

146
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,260
tell what where is my domain file what

147
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,060
all domains are associated with this

148
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,070
node manager it will be given in this

149
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,810
fight

150
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,060
where's my java home what is the lesson

151
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,360
address for this this node manager

152
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,220
what is the listen port for this node

153
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,810
manager and it's blank which means it is

154
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,800
running on all the IP addresses

155
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,790
configured on this machine

156
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,780
what is the listen port and so on so we

157
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,170
come out of this file here and then the

158
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,180
node manager dot property domain file

159
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,980
will have what all domains are

160
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,500
associated with this node manager so we

161
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,840
will see here and say this one domain

162
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,570
which is the the base domain and this is

163
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,070
the location of this domain that is how

164
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,920
you see or you can figure it or you

165
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,250
start it now as I said earlier there

166
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,750
will be association with the machine and

167
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,130
I am going to tell you machine in a

168
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,170
minute but let's first go and try to

169
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,070
start a server in the WebLogic console

170
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,630
through a web logic console so I have a

171
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,840
server called for example sua server and

172
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,240
I go and try to start this server I will

173
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,960
say control and I'll select the sua

174
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,480
server and say start and the minute I

175
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,730
start the server it says the so server

176
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,520
does not have a machine associated with

177
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,610
this and what is the machine which is we

178
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,560
can configure it from here I'll come

179
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,050
I'll go and explain the now front

180
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,440
presentation so machine is nothing but

181
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,300
it identifies a physical host on which

182
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,980
the server is running that server could

183
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,170
be an admin server or that server could

184
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,860
be a managed server so machine is used

185
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,170
to associate a WebLogic server with the

186
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,260
host on which that that managed server

187
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,570
admin server runs it is used by the node

188
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,260
manager to start if a server or restart

189
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,670
a failed server it's also used by

190
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,120
cluster or or or in a scenario where the

191
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,340
serve the session information needs to

192
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,260
be replicated in selecting the closest

193
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,059
cluster member to replicate that session

194
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,860
again be able to cover that in high

195
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,050
availability a module will be good deep

196
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,810
dive into this cluster communication but

197
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,210
if node manager is up and if the

198
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,830
services are started using new manager

199
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,210
it will be used in that scenario

200
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,690
so what happens so what how I do or what

201
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,470
I go here is I can create a machine on

202
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,540
which I want to start the sewer server

203
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,940
and then associate this managed server

204
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,770
through this machine so I'll go and to

205
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,750
server here and I'll create a machine

206
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,570
called new machine so I take a control

207
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,700
called lock and edit and say new machine

208
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,800
and I can give this name this machine

209
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,480
any name of my choice it's just a

210
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,030
virtual or or a logical representation

211
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,450
of the actual machine on which I want to

212
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,700
start this server so I will say it's 0 1

213
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,820
and say it's off a type UNIX machine

214
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,230
because I know it's a Linux or UNIX

215
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,640
machine which is 1 or 2 IP now this is

216
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,680
what I was saying is that each machine

217
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,680
will have a Associated node manager so

218
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,870
now this is the node manager properties

219
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,510
how the node manager is running so by

220
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,640
default node manager can run in SSL as

221
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,910
are SH plain SSL leave it to default SSL

222
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,640
and I say on which machine this node

223
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,410
manager I want or machine to be

224
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,540
associated and I want to associate this

225
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,300
machine then appropriate node manager on

226
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,730
which this node manager is running so

227
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,700
I'll say 192 dot 168 I want to run it on

228
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,160
the same machine so a 1 + 1 0 - I could

229
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,090
have done localhost as well save and say

230
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:19,120
finish now this machine should be

231
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,400
associated to the manage server that I

232
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,140
want to start so I'll go to servers I'll

233
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,350
say so a server and I say now this is

234
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,770
associated with this so a 1 and save it

235
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,710
and I activate the changes which means

236
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:39,400
now if let it save so now if I want to

237
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,930
start the sua server the so our server

238
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,900
admin server will check where this - a -

239
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,780
server is way is is running or which

240
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,730
machine this is associated with with

241
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,580
this and if you go to that machine or my

242
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,900
admin server will go to that machine and

243
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,990
see what is the node manager associated

244
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,270
with that so in this machine are at node

245
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,450
manager and say so that means admin

246
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,579
server has to

247
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,509
send a command to this node manager with

248
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:14,040
listening on this machine on this port

249
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,769
and say hey go and start is to a server

250
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:19,379
and that's how this is going to work so

251
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,939
let's suppose if I go and start the

252
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:24,029
service on so and I try to start and see

253
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:28,100
a and say it start now this time I'm not

254
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,389
getting that error which I got earlier

255
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,220
saying hey there's no machine associated

256
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,929
because now we have associated a machine

257
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:36,410
here so I'll say yes started

258
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,179
however it's saying a request has been

259
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,129
sent to start the selected server

260
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:42,420
which means the request has gone that

261
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,149
means when that looks like the managed

262
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,529
server or the node manager is running

263
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:48,869
that's why a brick quest has gone so

264
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,910
otherwise if node - is down you will see

265
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,920
another error saying the node manager is

266
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,739
not available or down so if you see here

267
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:58,739
now I saw associated leave right now on

268
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:00,660
14th of April just few minutes ago and

269
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,660
it has sent a command to issue or it has

270
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,660
started or issued a command to start the

271
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,600
show underscore server 1 which means now

272
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,220
it has started or issued the command

273
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,279
this is how the machine or node manager

274
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,069
and machines are associated within a

275
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,139
domain so let me do a quick recap on

276
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,989
this so node manage is nothing but a

277
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:23,519
java process and if want to see the

278
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,779
process now if you want to see the

279
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,720
process you simply see and say PS - Kiev

280
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,980
and fight and grep for - I and node

281
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:39,449
manager and node manager and so this is

282
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:42,660
my node manager process which says it's

283
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,569
using this JDK it's starting with 32 MB

284
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:48,720
mmm and it can go up to 200 MB if

285
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,959
required and this is WebLogic node node

286
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,230
manager and so it's nothing but a java

287
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,259
process which is used to remotely start

288
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:00,419
and stop in managed server or services

289
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:06,360
or also restart a failed server services

290
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,879
can run without a node manager but if

291
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,919
you won't as I said earlier to be

292
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,869
started using a remotely WebLogic

293
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:14,579
scripting tool or console then node

294
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,559
manager is required machine is nothing

295
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,910
but a a it identifies about physical

296
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,960
host on which you

297
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,650
- satay server or associate a WebLogic

298
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,230
server or to do that it's used by node

299
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,560
manager and you also used in a cluster

300
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,480
cluster communication when when we look

301
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,010
at high availability we'll be going too

302
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,590
deep into that and just already showed

303
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,050
you how machine and node manager are

304
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,030
associated with each other so you go to

305
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,220
servers under server each server will

306
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,290
have a machine associated each machine

307
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,240
will have a node manager associated with

308
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,000
that and that's how these machine and

309
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,550
node manager are related now head on to

310
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,410
the next lesson when we look at security

311
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,420
realm which is another important topic

312
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,220
where you will look at how the users

313
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,980
security realm will have a something

314
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,870
called as authentication providers

315
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,540
authorization providers users groups

316
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,210
embedded LDAP servers rules all these

317
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,530
things we are going to look at into the

318
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,660
next lesson which is security lesson or

319
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,880
security realm I'll see you in next

320
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,240
lesson
