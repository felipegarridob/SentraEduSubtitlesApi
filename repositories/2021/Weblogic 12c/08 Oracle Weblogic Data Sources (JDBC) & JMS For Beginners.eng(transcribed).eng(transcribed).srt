1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,040
so welcome back to another lesson in

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,009
this WebLogic training and in this

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,230
lesson we are going to look at data

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,110
source and Jamie's Java messaging server

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,900
but before that let me do a quick recap

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,630
on what we have covered so far so we

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,449
started with oracle weblogic 12c and 11g

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,640
where i mentioned that these are the

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
topics that we are going to cover so a

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,810
Giunta for this entire module including

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,210
multi-tenancy which is yet to come

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,369
then we'll go after that we'll go into

13
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,340
installation of WebLogic both 12c as

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,510
well as 11g so we discussed about what

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,250
is the verb logic server what are the

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,930
administration tasks for the logic

17
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,690
admins what the tools available for web

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,879
logic admins so things like admin

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,160
console fusion will control the logic

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,410
scripting tool restful management

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,480
resources we'll see all these incoming

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,910
modules then we looked at the logic

23
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,379
domain which is one of the most

24
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,270
important thing which is nothing but a

25
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,449
logical collection of servers and

26
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,090
associated resources for that then what

27
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,069
are things come consist of within a

28
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,890
domain in which way domain can be

29
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,570
deployed which is one installation

30
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,460
multiple domain or one domain but

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,979
multiple installations we also looked at

32
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,290
what is domain home what is some of the

33
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,630
key important files within domain home

34
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,390
then we looked at servers we also looked

35
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,549
at two different type of servers which

36
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,619
is had been in manage servers we also

37
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,750
looked at the Java Virtual Machine or

38
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,689
JVM we looked at what is the minimum

39
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,689
memory what is the maximum memory then

40
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,270
within admin server we said admin server

41
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,430
is a singleton service and managed

42
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,490
server is a app service or managed

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,409
server is a server on which you deploy

44
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,100
your applications or custom applications

45
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,740
we also discussed about the association

46
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,420
between admin and manage servers and

47
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,409
what are clusters and within how does

48
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,090
cluster communicate to each other I

49
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,340
mentioned that in the coming modules we

50
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,530
also have high availability will we look

51
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:04,890
at

52
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,960
unicast and multicast cluster

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,288
communication then the new concept

54
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,810
introduced in WebLogic 12c that's called

55
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,620
as dan

56
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,599
make clusters we're good to go deep into

57
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,450
these dynamic clusters or in what

58
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,150
components support in what don't sub

59
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,430
component not support will come cover

60
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,340
that in subsequent modules as well then

61
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,329
we looked at within dynamic cluster the

62
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:32,879
servers that created in dynamic cluster

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,220
is called as dynamic service which are

64
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,290
based on a server template so this is

65
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,299
what we covered in the previous lesson

66
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:42,540
now let's look at JDBC or data sources

67
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,079
so when WebLogic server is an

68
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,959
application server that hosts or deploy

69
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,299
application on top of that however the

70
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:53,430
data for that application goes into the

71
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,340
database and the way or how an

72
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,769
application server connects to the

73
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,840
database or how WebLogic connects to the

74
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,810
database is using JDBC that stands for

75
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,859
Java database connectivity now so what

76
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:10,620
you do you create a data source and how

77
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,120
to create a data source be able to look

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,920
in a minute and there are different

79
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,659
types of data sources we'll look in that

80
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:16,140
as well

81
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,150
so the way to connect or the the way

82
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,769
WebLogic server connection to a database

83
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,130
it uses JDBC there are different type of

84
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,980
data sources and one of them is generic

85
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,799
data source which will be used if you

86
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,260
have a database like single node

87
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,030
database of single instance database

88
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,459
which could be an Oracle database my my

89
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,620
sequel database or any other databases

90
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,720
you will have you will create genre data

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,930
sources then you also can create a grid

92
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,489
link data source and what that grid

93
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,049
links data source will come into picture

94
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,900
is when you have it Oracle database with

95
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,510
rack or stands for real application

96
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,639
cluster now if you're not familiar with

97
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,530
Iraq you need to understand just one

98
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,780
high level that it's nothing but same

99
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,660
database but running two instances on

100
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,480
two machines for high availability so

101
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,849
you put a grid link data source which

102
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,699
will connect from the Balaji to first

103
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,299
node and also second node and as new

104
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,149
node of database connects or become part

105
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,060
of rack cluster the generic data source

106
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,270
will automatically add or remove as and

107
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,270
when a rack database node being

108
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,539
added at the back end or removed so grid

109
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:32,520
link data source if you're part of

110
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,289
Oracle Fusion Middleware we're also

111
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:36,150
going to go deep into this grid link

112
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,620
data source when we look at high

113
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,229
availability module then there is a

114
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,000
multi data source which is same as

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,220
multiple versions or multiple genetic

116
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:47,970
data sources

117
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,720
we'll make a grid or multi data source

118
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,479
what will have same metadata source will

119
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,610
again come into picture when you have a

120
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,069
rank database so suppose you have two

121
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:02,280
node rack database or real application

122
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,349
cluster database or three node rack

123
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:07,560
database each instance of rack database

124
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,990
will have a generic data source and

125
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,060
collection of these generic data sources

126
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,860
will have a multi data source assume

127
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,500
that one pipe then going into three

128
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,849
different pipe or two different pipe

129
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:20,099
based on number of rack database nodes

130
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:22,229
that together will make a multi data

131
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:23,940
source we'll see that as well when we

132
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,800
look at high availability so these are

133
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,599
three different ways of did or three

134
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:29,190
different type of data sources that you

135
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,250
can create now multi data source and a

136
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,400
grid link both are for rack grid link is

137
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,919
a little bit more advanced feature and

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,020
depending on the WebLogic version which

139
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,820
you are using it you may have to pay

140
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,710
some extra license fee for to use that

141
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,229
feature however the license fee is

142
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:51,060
outside scope of this this course so but

143
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,219
it could be free as well the advantage

144
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,830
of using grid link is when the any

145
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,469
back-end database node gets added or

146
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:01,229
removed from a rack cluster of the

147
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,750
database the applica

148
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,580
the WebLogic server will automatically

149
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,430
add or remove because it's a grid link

150
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,960
so Gridlink have that feature

151
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,150
now these configurations are stored

152
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,210
under domain home config JDBC so entire

153
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,340
domain as we discussed earlier this it's

154
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,810
something called as a domain home all

155
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,090
the configurations will go inside domain

156
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,960
home config and JDBC folder so let's

157
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,810
connect to the web logic console of 12c

158
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,430
and see how does it look like and be

159
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,080
able to go and quickly create a database

160
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,020
if possible or and where these we'll see

161
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,849
also see where these files are stored on

162
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:40,289
the file system so I am on the console

163
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:40,710
here

164
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,560
and this is a change Center which means

165
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,600
if I need to make any modifications and

166
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,140
if my WebLogic domain is configured in a

167
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,070
production mode

168
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,810
we'll see that what is the production

169
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,610
mode in a minute or in subsequent

170
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,160
lessons but for now assume that in order

171
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,660
for me to make any changes in this

172
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,510
console I need to enable a lock which

173
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,060
I've already done and then I you go to

174
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,880
services and go to data sources and from

175
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,310
here from data sources you go and create

176
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,160
a new data source so you drop down and

177
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,620
say what kind of data sources you want

178
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,630
now because it's it well see there are

179
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,550
two more data services being added which

180
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,740
is proxy data source and UCP and we'll

181
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,290
be I'll be adding that as a bonus lesson

182
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,780
on these two additional data sources so

183
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,660
we let we have going to country create a

184
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,940
generic data source and in generic data

185
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,710
source you will give the name so we will

186
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,020
say that JDBC for example DB one and

187
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,320
scope again we could look at scope in

188
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,720
subsequent lesson in this in this module

189
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,470
we're Skoob feature but introduced

190
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,600
because multi-tenancy feature or

191
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,640
multi-tenancy feature introduced into NC

192
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,240
now jndi name will be the name used by

193
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,620
the application to use this database so

194
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,300
instead of application will not use this

195
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,500
name called JDBC DB one the application

196
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,860
if needs to access this JDBC it's going

197
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,410
to use this jndi name here so we will

198
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,600
specify some J&D a name and you specify

199
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,090
with what database you want to connect

200
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,580
and then in subsequent screens you need

201
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,590
to provide the database hostname port

202
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,810
number and configuration and other

203
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,970
details for connecting to the specific

204
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,680
database and you finish a complete

205
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,860
successfully and that's how you create

206
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,570
JDBC we'll go into these details when we

207
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,940
go and look at in if you're looking this

208
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,710
infusion will be a training then you are

209
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,419
going to look in and we go deep dive

210
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,500
into this in in the sewer module or

211
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,570
we'll see some of these JDBC s depending

212
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,340
on where you're looking will go in

213
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,620
detail about this ma this JDBC

214
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,470
now if you look at the configuration

215
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,750
file where these configurations are or

216
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,430
where with this configuration we'll go

217
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,620
we are it's going to go into domain home

218
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,339
and then config folder and inside that

219
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:05,779
config folder you will have all the

220
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,820
configurations of WebLogic domain will

221
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,829
be under domain home conflict inside

222
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:11,750
that they'll be a folder called JDBC and

223
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,790
that's where my Java database

224
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,310
configurations are this config dot XML

225
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,140
files the main configuration for entire

226
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,269
domain my gdb sees will be here and

227
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,519
because I don't have any JDBC or any

228
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,649
database connection right now in this

229
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,450
domain because there is no domain here

230
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,399
are details configured in that's why I

231
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,350
don't see any configuration let's

232
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,420
connect to another WebLogic domain or

233
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,180
another machine that has this JDBC and

234
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,010
we'll connects with that machine and see

235
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,930
how does it look like so I'm connecting

236
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,540
to another WebLogic domain and now in

237
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,140
that which this is a 12-11 GData

238
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,430
WebLogic server so our web project

239
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,100
console here under data sources I have

240
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,279
all these JDBC s so if I connect to the

241
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,860
putti to the backend server or let me

242
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,600
connect to this one of the NC you how

243
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,420
does it look like so I'm connecting to

244
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,339
Oracle access manager datasource and I

245
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:03,440
can look at connection pool will give me

246
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,630
information like this is my database

247
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,269
hostname this is my port number this is

248
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:11,510
my service name it's using using or

249
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,010
connecting using a user called dev

250
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,040
underscore om and shown where this or

251
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,529
what all servers WebLogic server can use

252
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,449
this JDBC that will be available under

253
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:23,089
targets which means this gdb C is

254
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,610
targeted to admin server or empathy

255
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,570
manager and om cluster so what you see

256
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,970
here this is my this is being targeted

257
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,490
so this JDBC can only be used by admin

258
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:34,970
server

259
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,880
oh Emily C manager and om cluster if my

260
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,339
bi server will try to connect that or

261
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,449
use this Jane di or this JDBC then which

262
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:48,019
using JDBC OMD this if not it won't be

263
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,670
able to do that because it will say hey

264
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,970
no debate no JDBC connection found

265
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,449
because this gdb C is targeted only on

266
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:58,790
selective admin and managed server and

267
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,370
cluster not to all servers now if we

268
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,810
look at the same thing for config

269
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,790
which in point of view so I'll connect

270
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:18,969
to another server no this is wrong so

271
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,650
I'm going to into this domain where my

272
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,560
domain are the domain that has JDBC I'll

273
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,029
go into same domain home config and then

274
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:43,400
JDBC so under config folder I will also

275
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,490
have JDBC and now if you see here each

276
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,190
JDBC that I have in the back end here so

277
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,279
each JDBC or each data source here so

278
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,779
they are around 17 of them

279
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,960
I should have 17 or so files here one

280
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,240
each representing a data source so now

281
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,580
if you are hitting any problem and you

282
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,990
want to know where the database is

283
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,029
connect or where this JDBC is connecting

284
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,810
to I can go to OEM deep DB JDBC and open

285
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,300
it and you'll tell me my hostname port

286
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,820
number and service name this is my

287
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,670
database username password is stored in

288
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,660
an encrypted AES algorithm base or AES

289
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,780
it uses AES encryption method to encrypt

290
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,420
the password for this schema and on the

291
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,720
on the the WebLogic server so that's

292
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,110
about weblog that's about JDBC now let's

293
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,089
look at one more topic before we hadn´t

294
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,440
to the next lesson

295
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,280
so JMS and Jamis is in a simple terms

296
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,920
nothing but Java messaging server which

297
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,600
is now which enables or JMS enables

298
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,100
applications or multiple applications or

299
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,320
different applications to s

300
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,300
synchronously communicate with each

301
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,790
other using messages so I have an

302
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,040
application one and it needs to send a

303
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,779
message to another application you use

304
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,839
JMS by s and conversely sending these

305
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,230
messages across each other and WebLogic

306
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,589
support that JMS implementation now Jim

307
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,280
the applications in within within

308
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,600
WebLogic server or JMS it can

309
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,630
Jamis blind or JMS server or both so

310
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,550
within that it can act both Jamie's

311
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,480
client and Jamie's server now the

312
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,350
application that's sending or that's

313
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,380
sending the message will be become a

314
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,779
producer and the application that

315
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,790
collects that message will become a

316
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,550
consumer within JMS client server

317
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,720
architecture and WebLogic supports JMS

318
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,060
1.1 specification so and how do you

319
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,190
create Jamis again you depending on

320
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,990
which WebLogic server you are there

321
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,130
might be slight differences or or slight

322
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,139
navigation path difference you again go

323
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,990
back to the WebLogic domain and here you

324
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,569
should have messaging and jamester what

325
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:03,699
you see here the logic domain messaging

326
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,889
JMS server and this little bit more as

327
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:07,839
well however if you are listening this

328
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,910
be able to cover in in WebLogic course

329
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,009
so depending on if you're listening this

330
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:13,810
in WebLogic we are going to go deep into

331
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,839
this JMS a little bit further if you're

332
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,279
listening it in Fusion Middleware

333
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:20,769
or so ah we'll go slightly when we look

334
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:23,800
at so uh store that's when we are going

335
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,569
to touch base again a little bit more

336
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:28,209
about JMS but this is how you go and

337
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:31,000
create JMS from here so let me do a

338
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,829
quick recap on this lesson just on a

339
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:36,550
quick JDBC is nothing but a way to

340
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,949
connect from WebLogic server to the

341
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:41,589
database intel 11g there are three ways

342
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,870
to connect which is a generic grid link

343
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,060
and multi data source into NC there are

344
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,160
two more which we got added which you've

345
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,319
solved just the earlier and we able to

346
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:52,089
cover that I'm going to add a bonus

347
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,730
lesson in a minute on within in this

348
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,910
module multi data source and griddling

349
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,399
are both for rack database that send for

350
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,709
real application cluster and the

351
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,449
configurations are stored in domain home

352
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:07,389
config JDBC JMS it's basically

353
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:10,269
asynchronous messaging between two

354
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:12,910
applications so this is all about JDBC

355
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,550
and JMS in WebLogic now head on to the

356
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,680
next lesson we will look at node manager

357
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,100
and machine and this is again one of the

358
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,290
important or one of the topics which we

359
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,059
get lot of questions especially around

360
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,670
the machine and node manager and how I

361
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,320
start my servers on

362
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,720
- over to the WebLogic service remotely

363
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,780
or from a from a web logic console so

364
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,280
head on to the next lesson we look at

365
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,770
node manager and machines in WebLogic

366
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:44,230
server I'll see you in next lesson
