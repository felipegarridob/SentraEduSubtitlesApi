00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,090
welcome back to this lesson on WebLogic

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,009
domain in the previous lesson we looked

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,600
at the rules and responsibilities but

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,340
let's focus on now this is one of the

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,080
most important topic which is about

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,410
WebLogic domain and so domain is nothing

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,539
but a logical collection of resources or

8
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:20,460
servers and what are the resources what

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,080
are the servers be able to cover that in

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
a minute but what you see on the right

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,920
hand side image is nothing but a an

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,050
initiation server call a couple of

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,619
manage servers and resources or services

14
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,440
and then clusters all combined together

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,630
in a logical container is called as a

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,840
WebLogic domain or a domain so a domain

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,480
will always have one and mandatory one

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,719
admin server it can have 0 to n minus

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,600
servers so it can have you can create as

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,370
many many servers as you want

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,440
I think biggest I have seen is 246 or 2

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,850
to 250 roughly on to 264 I think it

23
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,489
could be more I worked on maximum on

24
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,399
that amount so you can have 0 to n minus

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,860
servers you can have 0 to n clusters

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,990
what is admin server what is managed

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,320
server

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,030
what is cluster you are going to look

29
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,010
that in a minute on that particular

30
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,070
topic then there are resources and

31
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,369
services so things like machine will see

32
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,750
what exactly is machine in coming

33
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,240
lessons it can have a network channel

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,090
through which data moves it could be

35
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,040
potent combination of port and protocol

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,380
you can have virtual hosts will see what

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,049
exactly is virtual host it can have G DB

38
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,170
C Java database connectivity or JMS Java

39
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,060
messaging server and so on so these are

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,000
resources and services then in tab

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,939
domain configuration is stored in a file

42
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,399
base repository and that file based

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,140
repository is called as or the location

44
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,149
is under domain who config configure and

45
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,490
examine what is domain whom we covered

46
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,110
it in module 1 or previous module we

47
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,930
looked at what exactly is to mean so

48
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,579
within the domain whom there is a full

49
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,439
to code country and within that config

50
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,270
folder you have a file called config dot

51
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,119
XML the entire configuration of that

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,770
entire domain is stored in this file

53
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,530
configuration file so that's about

54
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,209
WebLogic domain in high level will go

55
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,030
deep dive into these building blocks so

56
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,860
what I mean by build

57
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,500
block or deployment or topologies what

58
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,590
you have is these domains can be

59
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,530
organized in a particular format and we

60
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,350
will see that what the format is and

61
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,900
domain will have a domain home domain

62
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,970
will have a servers and within servers

63
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,950
you will have admin and manage servers

64
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,710
you will have clusters you will have

65
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,870
machines you will have doing directory

66
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,940
you will have the admin console so each

67
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,610
domain will have its own admin console

68
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,890
on the project console so this is all

69
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,459
about a domain let's quickly cover that

70
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,910
in for how domain topology or how domain

71
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,610
can be organized so you have left hand

72
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,739
side you see image which you have a web

73
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,380
logic server software installed and then

74
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,080
you run a utility called config dot SH

75
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,840
and from that utility you created domain

76
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,860
which is represented by domain 1 then

77
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,980
you rerun that domain configured SH one

78
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,420
more time and say I'm creating another

79
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,580
domain so you might have one domain for

80
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,620
a development environment another domain

81
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,230
for a test environment third domain for

82
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,709
Quality Assurance or QA moment so one

83
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,630
single WebLogic installation but

84
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,890
multiple domains

85
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,440
that's one topology or you can have

86
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,769
multiple each multiple installation so

87
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:36,959
you have machine one machine to machine

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,640
three or different am talking about

89
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,620
machine is um a word operating system or

90
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,150
virtual machine or virtual machines

91
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,290
which are a actual servers and on these

92
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,410
servers you have multiple web logic

93
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,500
installed and each you have single

94
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,130
domain covering multiple machines I

95
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,720
repeat one more time there are multiple

96
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,440
web logic servers and this is called as

97
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,820
horizontal clustering or high

98
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,530
availability we'll cover that in when we

99
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,239
look at the high will between disaster

100
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,150
covey we discuss about vertical and

101
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,010
horizontal clustering so this is

102
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,140
horizontal clustering in that year of a

103
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,730
logic server one WebLogic server two of

104
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,350
logics over three on three different

105
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,680
machines and my domain is being used of

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,750
single domain covering three of logic

107
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,090
servers will see that as well when we

108
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,220
cover in high so these are multiple ways

109
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,720
in which domain can be deployed

110
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,040
so so this is in all about topology on

111
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,860
domain we look at about domain home and

112
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,300
lot of other things like servers and

113
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,520
enemy server incoming less than or the

114
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,650
next lesson but for now let me do a

115
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,970
quick recap for this lesson

116
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,040
would we have you have a WebLogic domain

117
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,600
which is nothing but a logical

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,780
collection it has one admin server

119
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,000
mandate Creon always only one it can

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,730
have 0 2 and manage servers it can have

121
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,430
0 to n clusters it have other services

122
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,620
or resources like Machine Network

123
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,810
channel virtual host Java data is

124
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,630
connected JMS and so on the thumb free

125
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,100
edition is stored in a config dot XML

126
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,860
file it has these components as I said

127
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,680
just now and you can deploy or have one

128
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,150
verb logic software installation and

129
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,220
multiple domains or multiple member

130
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,750
logic software installations on multiple

131
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,380
machines but all using with having one

132
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,210
WebLogic domain so these are this is a

133
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,340
topology you can do now and on to the

134
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,050
next lesson we will look at the Blodgett

135
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,030
domain we go a little bit deep into the

136
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,729
domain so I will see you in next lesson
