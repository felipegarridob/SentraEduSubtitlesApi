and I'm going to focus for from a from

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,700
applications or from a web logic point

55
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,890
of view and also if you have any

56
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,330

that those who are here a he Pablo of

64
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,690

okay so hi everyone make sure you post

67
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,980
your questions that you have but this is

68
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,450
what we have to begin with we'll start

69
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,480
with WebLogic overview very quickly then

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,970
tasks performed by admins then we are

71
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,320
going to there was one question being

72
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,780
asked in past which was about that a

73
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,340
oracle ebusiness with art world or two

74
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,830
runs web logic or is run on top of

75
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,780
WebLogic server and that WebLogic server

76
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,900
has managed servers and sometimes these

77
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,060
manage servers go in a warning state

78
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,500
i'll show you all what you mean by

79
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,180
warning so why do they go in that

80
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,740
warning state it said we're going to

81
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,020
look at g vm memory uses garbage

82
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,240
collection heap dump stack dump thread

83
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,290
dump what are these

84
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,590
how does memory look like so just to UM

85
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,480
little bit excited because this is

86
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,130
something i've never covered spatially

87
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,020
not even in any training so this is what

88
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,360
we are going to look at as well what is

89
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,910
a young generation what is old

90
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,100
generation what is a heap

91
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,230
what is the permanent generation how

92
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,940
does garbage collection look like and

93
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,730
some of these performance are things as

94
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,200
well so make sure you ask a lot of

95
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,358
questions you come even if you are not a

96
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,190
apps DBA you are going to get tons of

97
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,800
value web logic is used everywhere

98
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,790
pretty much every

99
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,070
so you'll get tons of value so going

100
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,220
back and also if you if you at any point

101
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,620
in time you like this session don't

102
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,070
forget to don't forget to share and and

103
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,350
leave a comment to me and tell me and

104
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,450

you have are you guys AB see behaves or

112
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,810
not and have you worked on WebLogic or

113
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,070
not so this is what we'll be able to

114
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,640
cover so but before we go on to hold on

115
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,460
yeah I think I moved forward so this is

116
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,430
what I'll be able to cover but earlier

117
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,050
in the show so I have this weekly

118
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,980
session so early in the show this is all

119
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,840
we have covered in Xero one cloud like

120
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,180
zero one we covered cloud service model

121
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,280
zero three we covered 12-point checklist

122
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,010
to go from DBA to cloud DBA and so on so

123
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,120
I'm going to move a little bit quicker

124
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,280
but if you want you can come back again

125
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,220
here and have a look at this if anything

126
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,380
of your interest all out plenty of

127
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,900
useful information in all this previous

128
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,760
shows everything is available on

129
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,750
Facebook as well also I did a Fae a

130
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,790

131
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,410
there guys so I did a Facebook life I do

132
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,820
not Facebook like I did a free webinar

133
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,160
on WebLogic Oracle WebLogic server 12c

134
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,950
what why and how so these questions came

135
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,300
from there so if you want to go and

136
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,040
attend that as well later go back to

ketone in academy.com ford slash web

138
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,440
logic 0 2 so before i start everything

139
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,870
let's do a quick win and shout out for

140
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,300
some of you guys made progress last week

141
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,480
so big congratulations for this is for

142
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,710
from Quinn Lee for migrating Oracle

143
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,780
e-business suite lifting or migrating

144
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,090
from on-premise to cloud so big big

145
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,030
commute relations also to acknowledge he

146
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,890
also did lift and shift it was a little

147
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,720
bit painful exercise and why it was

148
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,820
painful was because I think Oracle

149
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,080
changed something with respect to

150
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,600
certificates so we are going to add I am

151
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,160
going to a blog about it and I am going

152
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,220
to tell you that as well

153
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,660

00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,039
WebLogic perfect so if you know WebLogic

184
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,300
you should be able to correlate i'm

185
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,340
going to show it today with respect to

186
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,260
oracle e-business suite how does it look

187
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,080
like in e-business way today so what is

188
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,300
WebLogic those who are new who don't

189
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,830
know WebLogic is nothing but an

190
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,380
application server and it's Java EE

191
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,229
Enterprise Edition compliant server it

192
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:31,150
could be high version of picked up maybe

193
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,610
seven but it could be eight or nine I'm

194
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,469
not hunter percent confident but Java EE

195
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,049
complained what do you do you deploy and

196
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,919
run you deploy run and distribute Java

197
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,750
applications on that so any java

198
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,060
application you can write you can you

199
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,860
run it on top of application server

200
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,850
which is Rob logic

201
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,850
now it also access other services like

202
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,339
databases messaging external enterprise

203
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:57,190
systems like so uh sweet or cloud or any

204
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,350
so you can connect from WebLogic to

205
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,630
other enter external service or LDAP

206
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,209
servers as well where is it use pretty

207
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,670
much every product and so if you have

208
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,830
not worked on WebLogic you should start

209
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,770
learning a web logic because whether you

210
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,529
work on premise or you go on cloud it's

211
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:16,750
going to be used and way why because

212
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,540
it's used in sua it's using OPI E which

213
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,250
is Oracle business intelligence and why

214
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,709
the reason it's being used in Oracle

215
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,660
access manager identity manager it's

216
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,890
being used in EBS at 12.2 so 12.2 uses

217
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,870
WebLogic earlier they used to be other

218
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,420
application server so tell me now what

219
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,730
that application server was tell me what

220
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,830
was the application server in a bs11 ID

221
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,589
and what was eleven even 12.1 let's see

222
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,089
who can answer those are with the ab c--

223
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:43,870
BIA background

224
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,660
apart from that fuse and applications

225
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,310
also uses the

226
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,199
as an underlying application server

227
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:52,300
anything that runs from the cloud in a

228
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,879
SAS software this service uses WebLogic

229
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,079
Enterprise Manager 13c uses Oh give me

230
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,730
one second sighs I need to close the

231
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:09,610
doors sorry for that again extremely

232
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,819
sorry guys um this is yeah so enter

233
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,620
phase manager 13 see also uses for D

234
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,129
behave

235
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:17,529
now what 12c so those who are coming

236
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:20,230
from 11g background in 12c WebLogic

237
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,420
server supports multi-tenancy so we

238
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,999
covered this in the free webinar which

239
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,790
i've covered earlier on how to how to

240
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,439
get out of that free 90 minute webinar

241
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:32,199
where we covered 12c multi-tenancy some

242
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,720
of the features like partitioning of

243
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,819
micro containers so leave a comment to

244
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,589
me or leave a comment and someone will

245
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:40,959
share at the webinar replay link if you

246
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,870
want so it's basically one domain so

247
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,850
multi-tenancy is nothing but one domain

248
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,129
divided into multiple parts which is

249
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:50,709
called as partitions and if you are

250
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,110
familiar with docker so Oracle has fully

251
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,420
supported now WebLogic on top of docker

252
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,240
containers apart so similar to web logic

253
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,759
the other application servers are like

254
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,579
IBM websphere Apache Tomcat these are

255
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,220
two other famous application servers so

256
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,079
this is all in a nutshell about WebLogic

257
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,089
server what are some of the common tasks

258
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:12,339
done by administrators you do install

259
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,379
and configure or you install the project

260
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,029
server you configure the WebLogic domain

261
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:18,759
what you do you deploy applications that

262
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,129
applications could be test again if I'm

263
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:21,939
going fast

264
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:23,740
make sure you ask question I'm going to

265
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,230
answer those questions at each logical

266
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,399
point so you deploy applications on top

267
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,620
of and it could be a it will always be a

268
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,689
java application only but you can deploy

269
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:37,809
so a based application you can deploy a

270
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:40,179
web based applications you can deploy

271
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:42,429
enterprise applications quartz which is

272
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:44,499
commercially of the shelf products like

273
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:45,660
ebusiness suite

274
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,579
peoplesoft Hyperion or EPM or Enterprise

275
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,139
Performance Management Hyperion or

276
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:55,600
Fusion Applications they all use so

277
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,519
these are basically example of deploying

278
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,709
application on top of a blodgett also

279
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,450
admin they migrate domain

280
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,180
from test dev to prod you integrate with

281
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,710
identity and access management system

282
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,390
you troubleshoot issues and be able to

283
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,100
look at one of the issue today which is

284
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,870
about performance tuning where what

285
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,060
happens if your managed server in

286
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,650
e-business 2 it goes into into a running

287
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,620
or wait state then we are going to or

288
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,300
web admins they also do monitoring

289
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,130
management high availability set up

290
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,990
these are some of the things all

291
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,650
WebLogic admins do ok so let me take

292
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:36,210
question and ok so I usually saying I

293
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,220
usually say we are facing high heap uses

294
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,560
and high CPU uses continuously so I

295
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,060
usually so we are going to cover today

296
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,600
first of all what is heap and and CPU

297
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,610
and what scenarios it happens I briefly

298
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,470
on a high-level overview but I need a

299
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,150
little bit more detail in terms of what

300
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,670
that application is type what does your

301
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,530
JVM settings are do you understand what

302
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,450
is heap size and permanent size we are

303
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,800
going to cover and hopefully that will

304
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,320
give you some insights on to how you

305
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,580
troubleshoot how you can troubleshoot

306
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,680
Vamsi is saying Apache server in 11 I

307
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,220
know Apache was a web server in 11 I and

308
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,380
even in 11 I it's not Apache so that's a

309
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,270
web server so I asked a question earlier

310
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,860
saying oh what is were in 12.2

311
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,020
e-business suite I told to my

312
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,380
application server listens hold on let

313
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,180
me go and let me take these questions

314
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,290
and let me swap myself afraid so I asked

315
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,210
some questions earlier saying ebusiness

316
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,580
wait well dot 2 uses WebLogic server so

317
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,290
what are the previous version so 11 I

318
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,610
it's not it's not Apache Apache is a web

319
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,390
server I mean it's not a patch age it's

320
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,130
it's a web server and web server is

321
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,550
witches 11g OHS it uses OHS OHS is the

322
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,890
web server however 11 I it doesn't use

323
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,410
is a Apaches an application server it's

324
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,030
another application server the lexing

325
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,660
who can answer that we shall explain

326
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,730
12.2 architecture and how web logic is

327
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,290
integrated I'm going to show that it

328
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,070
today we shall definitely okay greet is

329
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,870
saying in EBS Oh a core I'm free

330
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,750
things tucked red ah and do we have five

331
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,700
Oh a core and three application server

332
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,070
okay so interesting question first of

333
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,320
all what is what is stuck thread what is

334
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,790
thread dump we are going to cover that

335
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,960
as well finally share webinar 12c AJ I

336
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,910
am going to leave a comment on that

337
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,130
so 12c webinar I'll share that as well

338
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,870
thinks I use okay good

339
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,700
thanks welcome Naga welcome Ranjith and

340
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,100
there's don't forget to give me a thumbs

341
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,760
up or little hearts as you see something

342
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,130
valuable coming okay so this is the free

343
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,510
webinar I was talking about Katyn

344
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,880
academy.com WebLogic 0 - there'll be a

345
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,800
workbook what we covered we covered all

346
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,270
these things what you see on the screen

347
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,450
so this is all things we covered we

348
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,890
covered what is WebLogic common tasks

349
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,779
tools then why you should learn web

350
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,730
logic we covered 12c architecture we

351
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,700
covered WebLogic domain JVM deployments

352
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,279
dynamic so we also covered clusters and

353
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,470
12c introduced a new concept called a

354
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,540
dynamic cluster which was not there in

355
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,390
11g in WebLogic so dynamic cluster and

356
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,130
how cluster communicate each other

357
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,400
including multicast versus unicast we

358
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,160
also looked at partitioning or

359
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,420
multi-tenancy in that we covered what is

360
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,040
micro container what is partitioning

361
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,870
what is virtual target what is the

362
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,850
resource isolation I also looked at

363
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,640
elfin checklist to learn like an expert

364
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,860
and then taking it to the next table so

365
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,360
this is all in the webinar that I

366
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,470
covered earlier

367
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,650
ok so let's begin with first question in

368
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,330
that webinar was asked by vivek there

369
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,070
were a lot of questions I answered some

370
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,660
but because of time we couldn't finish

371
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,400
all so this is what we are going to

372
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,670
cover first question is managed server

373
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,950
an e-business suite are 12.2 comes into

374
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,770
warning state so before I go and answer

375
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,810
that lets first so this was a question

376
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,550
being asked I'm working in Oracle

377
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,100
e-business suite Perl 2.3 my question is

378
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,260
that our way core manage servers are

379
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,150
going into warning state frequently and

380
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,270
so this is a note I added on top of that

381
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,640
which is Oh a code is nothing but one of

382
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,500
the manage servers in a very logic

383
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,630
domain how many of guys who don't know

384
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,730
about what is WebLogic domain if there's

385
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,830
anyone here I'm going to explain that

386
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,390
what is the verb logic domain those who

387
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,250
are not coming from 12.2 background or

388
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,200
not coming from WebLogic bad known if

389
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,720
this only someone who knows if everyone

390
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,310
knows about 12 herb logics

391
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,699
I'm going to skip that so what his

392
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,350
question was oh I have increased the

393
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,839
Java heap size so first of all what is

394
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,699
the heap size how do you increase it

395
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:40,519
from one get to 2gig is increasing from

396
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,740
1 to giggles a solution or is it

397
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,980
applicable for everything but he's still

398
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,050
getting this error and after collecting

399
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,399
the garbage collection so after

400
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,899
collecting garbage so what is garbage

401
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:54,559
how do you collect the garbage and is it

402
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,930
so his he's saying after collecting the

403
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,480
garbage it will it was okay but I want

404
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,999
to resolve this issue permanently how do

405
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:05,030
we solve it okay so what would you do if

406
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,619
you are in a situation like that wave

407
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,990
will you look will you simply increase 2

408
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,199
from 1 to 2 get are you able to do this

409
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,520
is something be able to cover all set

410
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,730
okay

411
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,520
so let's first begin with ABS 12.2

412
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,140
architecture and those this is for

413
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,689
oracle ebusiness wait for apps GBS and I

414
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:25,789
think those who are not coming from a

415
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:27,439
business sweet background will also find

416
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,340
it useful so ebusiness suite 12.2 has

417
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,230
like in previous versions is a

418
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,090
three-tier architecture you have a

419
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,500
database here you have an application

420
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,559
tier and you have a drip tier now in

421
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,240
database tier what are the some of the

422
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,220
changes which I can tell you now from

423
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,950
you can install 12c virgin database

424
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,429
using your start CD I think it's 51 so

425
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:51,500
when you install eby's this week there

426
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,909
is something called a start CD and

427
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:55,880
there's a number for that start CD so by

428
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,210
default in previous 12.2 Datuk 4 or 5 it

429
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,799
used to be 11g are 2 database now when

430
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,510
you start with 51 CD you get great

431
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:10,250
directly 12c now the 12c database other

432
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,559
thing which comes in ebusiness suite

433
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,679
12.2 is that during install time itself

434
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,049
you can do rack where is in previous

435
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:20,899
versions in 11 i or a 12.1 during

436
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,120
install you can't configure a rack you

437
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,919
install first single node database with

438
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,990
ebusiness suite and then you migrate it

439
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,690
to rack so that's difference or some

440
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,880
changes in on the database side also

441
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,919
there's a new concept called addition

442
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,370
based redefinition introduced for for

443
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,320
online patching which is another new

444
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,310
feature introduced in our 12.2

445
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,730
so then the major change happened on the

446
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,090
application tier in application tier

447
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,730
Oracle introduced WebLogic prior to that

448
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:57,410
in 12.1 there was OC for J so I asked

449
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,200
this question earlier that in 12.1 what

450
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,850
was the application server and

451
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,150
application server was OC for J Oracle

452
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,400
container for Java which is a 10 G

453
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,490
application server and prior to to L dot

454
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:15,380
1 or it 12.0 in 11 I it used to be J

455
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,560
serve Java server J sir which was 99

456
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,860
application server of oracle application

457
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,190
server prior to the WebLogic server so

458
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,100
that's called as J serve Java server so

459
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,530
in 12.2 oracle introduced WebLogic

460
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,760
server and application T or web tier is

461
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,670
sorry the the client here is pretty much

462
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,320
more or less same there are some

463
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,200
additional features or additional JDK

464
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,690
version so J GRE and new additional

465
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,080
browsers being supported so quickly the

466
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,480
database tier is this the application

467
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,750
tier new introduction is the logic and

468
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,240
web tier or planked here also there is a

469
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,620
dual patching and I think I've not

470
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,140
covered that on so I'll skip that at

471
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,970
that particular point now this is all

472
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,200
about 12.2 architecture now in 12.2

473
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,810
oracle also because it's WebLogic and

474
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,730
WebLogic has a concept called a domain

475
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,310
and there's no one who said I know what

476
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,900
I don't know I'm not sure should I cover

477
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,640
this so guys I'm going to wait for a

478
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,350
second and tell me should I cover

479
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,020
WebLogic domain or not are you clear

480
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,790
anyone even if once a person says Oh

481
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,590
cover logic domain I'm going to cover

482
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,180
that other result skip that the blodgett

483
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:32,110
domain I'll take a strip of water and

484
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,490
then I'll come to that point and tell me

485
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,470
should I it should we do WebLogic domain

486
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,290
or not in the meantime let me tell you

487
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,060
how does it WebLogic domain look like so

488
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,490
I'm connecting to one of my servers and

489
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,830
I think it's 63-65 console so this is I

490
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,330
am right now logging in this is an

491
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,250
Oracle e-business suite and I'm

492
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,640
connecting to 7:01 3 which

493
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,150
a WebLogic admin code so I say WebLogic

494
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,970
and click on login and Armani WebLogic

495
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,100
domain so this is called as a domain if

496
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,990
I go in left hand side and I click on

497
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,710
servers and then I see there is on top

498
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,570
there is an admin server and this is

499
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,250
managed server and it's very important

500
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,600
this is one of the most important thing

501
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,580
the whole thing that you see around is a

502
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,610
domain and there is a admin server and

503
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,660
there is madness servers

504
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,270
there's also applications deployed and

505
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,120
also the connectivity to the database so

506
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,410
what you see here datasource

507
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,960
so there are two data sources one is we

508
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,730
have its going to the e-business suite

509
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,910
database and also there is a oaa this is

510
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,010
this doesn't come by default on this

511
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,150
environment we are using this

512
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,950
environment this environment is also

513
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,650
integrated with Oracle access manager so

514
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,110
you have a additional man data source

515
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,299
connecting to the database called as oae

516
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:48,370
a so let me see if there's any question

517
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,110
related to should I cover the project

518
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,080
domain or not and if I see not even a

519
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,549
single person asking about domain I'll

520
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:57,250
skip that and if if otherwise if there's

521
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,049
a question then I'll cover that in a

522
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,910
minute but this is all itself WebLogic

523
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,160
domain coming from ebusiness suite are

524
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,460
12.2 so in servers you might be familiar

525
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,150
with in 11i as well as in 12c or sorry

526
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,760
in our 12.0 and 12.1 you have Oh a core

527
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,190
so you used to have OC 4 0 a code if you

528
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,500
are 12.1 if you're 11 I there's already

529
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,410
an OE core J sub similar to that here Oh

530
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,390
a core here also but it said a managed

531
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,390
server this is this is Oracle

532
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,600
application Fusion Middleware oae again

533
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,309
that doesn't come by default that comes

534
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:36,750
very empty this is my access gate Oracle

535
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,970
application ebusiness suite access gate

536
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,390
so oaa this is for EP om integration and

537
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,330
these are forms let me see and take any

538
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,210
questions if you guys have ok so I

539
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,340
should saying cover it at all please

540
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,620
cover and jeath we shall definitely okay

541
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,540
so let me cover very quickly what is

542
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,330
WebLogic domain it's nothing but logical

543
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:03,730
collection of all the resources clubbed

544
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,559
together so what I mean by the sources

545
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:08,190
is servers

546
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,960
all machines deployment is nothing but

547
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,929
web applicants or application deployment

548
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:18,350
or jar file deployment these deployments

549
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,870
also JDBC so these are applications so

550
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,429
if you see here there's a web

551
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:25,500
application called cat this is another

552
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,750
web application called DMS so collection

553
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,450
of all this is so logical collection of

554
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,830
all this is a web logic domain and

555
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,750
domain this is a two type of servers

556
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,880
admin server in a managed server and

557
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,950
it's always one and only one admin

558
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,500
server and multiple manage servers so

559
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,660
that's what we saw here and you will

560
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,179
always have once admin server in a

561
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:46,890
domain when you create and you can have

562
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,350
zero or n manage servers so this is what

563
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,650
you we see here now on these manage

564
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,510
server so admin server you deploy

565
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,429
something called as applications or

566
00:23:56,429 --> 00:23:58,710
resources which are nothing but war web

567
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,040
archive er enterprise archives are job

568
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,309
archive JDBC Java Java database

569
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:07,169
connectivity JMS Java messaging server

570
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:11,790
and each server has its own JVM Java

571
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,799
Virtual Machine what I mean by that is

572
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:18,059
so forms will have a OC for oh sorry JVM

573
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,760
this boy code will have a JVM this will

574
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,530
have a JVM this will you have a JVM as

575
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,540
long it's running and JVM is nothing but

576
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,360
a java virtual machine which is what

577
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,299
which is nothing but it executes your

578
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:33,299
Java class file on a microprocessor so

579
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,970
developers will write a Java Java file

580
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,770
they will compile that it will become

581
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,929
class file and those class file will be

582
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:41,730
combined them into a jar file

583
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,530
these are deployed in the server and

584
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:47,340
when you sum run these these Java files

585
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:52,500
are are executed bytecodes on the JVM so

586
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,330
how does GBM look like or how do you

587
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,940
know of it kind of a JVM we have let's

588
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,860
go and connect on to the server so I'm

589
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,440
connecting to one of EB a servers behind

590
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,990
putty so this is how you can see what is

591
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,179
the JVM running so I'm connecting at

592
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,760
Appl MGR which is my application tier

593
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,990
user and I'm going to show you how does

594
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,800
Geum look like give it a few minutes

595
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,100
guys

596
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,570
okay give me a feedback that are you

597
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,230
learning it is it making sense or not

598
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:31,690
and why it's not slow okay

599
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:34,780
okay while it connects maybe maybe

600
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,490
because it's waiting for your little

601
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,530
likes and the minute you give hurts and

602
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:43,270
likes and thumbs up it might come okay

603
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:46,170
white slow new session

604
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:54,130
EBS load open okay I don't know why it's

605
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,799
not working but this is this is inactive

606
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,100
or at a we are we are here now so PS UX

607
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,650
and pipe so all you need to do is if you

608
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,290
do want to find the JVM you say PSU

609
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,440
x-pipe and grep for grep - I and Java

610
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,590
so when you say grep - I Java so each of

611
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,840
these processes is a JVM so what do you

612
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,540
see here this is one JVM what you see

613
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,570
here it's running Java or JDK from here

614
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,940
this is the name of the JVM which is OFM

615
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,370
so earlier we saw this there is a OFM

616
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,470
but important and interesting fact or

617
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,740
interesting thing is what is this here

618
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,140
this is the key lot of you guys hit

619
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,960
these problems which is palm-sized 128 m

620
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,760
max palm-sized what 3384 XM s 1 0 - 4 XM

621
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,370
x 1 0 - 4 so tell me what is palm-sized

622
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:45,220
what is difference between XM x s and

623
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,679
pump size what are the pump size and XM

624
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,090
s denotes what I should sing definitely

625
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,070
I feel I'm learning a lot great thank

626
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,870
you very much so tell me guys leave a

627
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,190
comment and tell me and if you don't

628
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,660
know just say I don't know and and

629
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,970
that's why I can go in detail about if

630
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,250
you don't know about this so this is and

631
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,080
this is all your cleaning parameters

632
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,000
this is where the maximum tuning will

633
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,669
happen around JVM or Java Virtual

634
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:13,630
Machine so going back to this is the

635
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,480
manage servers which you see now I'm

636
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,669
going to also tell you how does it look

637
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:20,169
like or file system look like very

638
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:25,990
quickly so I go on to EBS apps and right

639
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,090
now you this a dual file system - I am

640
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,919
setting it environment variable to say

641
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,879
source the run edition

642
00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:34,339
again I'm not over what is a patchy

643
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:36,879
addiction or effects file edition but

644
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:39,949
there is a Fusion Middleware home in

645
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,299
e-business suite so I'm right now in

646
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:43,249
Fusion Middleware home and inside that

647
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:46,190
Fusion Middleware home I have my

648
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,589
WebLogic server this is my verb logic

649
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:53,209
home this is my actual TP or web server

650
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:55,999
home this is my under user projects I

651
00:27:55,999 --> 00:28:00,949
have my domain this is my web gate home

652
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:02,869
if you installer and ticket with

653
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:04,599
identity and access management system

654
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,969
this is a common home so I'm going to go

655
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:10,669
into the user projects and inside that

656
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:13,190
domains and this is my domain name which

657
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,190
is eeap's abs underscore domain

658
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,879
underscore sid and incite that i have

659
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:22,309
been this is where my starts top of this

660
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:24,859
domain are going to be this is where my

661
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:27,229
servers are going to be so if I go under

662
00:28:27,229 --> 00:28:30,559
servers folder and this is where my

663
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,949
admin server domain and these servers

664
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:38,319
are if I go back under config folder and

665
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,549
this is where the entire configuration

666
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:43,909
or WebLogic configuration will be under

667
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:50,919
here WebLogic config ok hold on VI

668
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:53,029
WebLogic dot XML

669
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:56,959
oh sorry config dot XML is my mistake so

670
00:28:56,959 --> 00:29:01,759
it will be config dot XML so how you

671
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,129
know where is my admin server port you

672
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:06,349
go and search for look for this admin

673
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:09,739
server here and it's saying my machine

674
00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:12,559
is this my listen 4701 3 it's listening

675
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,749
on address 1705 a cloud

676
00:29:14,749 --> 00:29:16,639
Cayden academy.com like so I need to

677
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:18,499
just this and that's why you see this

678
00:29:18,499 --> 00:29:20,839
I'm going directly by IP and this is the

679
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,699
port number seven zero one three four

680
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:25,279
slash console here ok so let's move on

681
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,479
now back to slide so this is about JVM

682
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:30,619
I've told you about WebLogic

683
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:32,809
configuration that where does WebLogic

684
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:34,339
configuration you set your environment

685
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,799
variable or an Edition go to another

686
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,899
environment variable or going directly

687
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:41,869
to do mean you go to EBS domain home

688
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:45,020
countries then you open config not XML

689
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,840
we'll file you will see file like admin

690
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,520
server look for admin server and listen

691
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,830
address and listen port number this is

692
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,210
the WebLogic domain I showed you earlier

693
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,420
this is how it look like this is the JVM

694
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,650
I told you earlier there is a XMS X MX

695
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,540
maximum size and other variable point

696
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,200
things on JVM so now comes the real crux

697
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,660
which is oh how this memory is being

698
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,820
used so whatever we saw in in earlier

699
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,450
this is JVM that you see here and we are

700
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,490
going to discuss next is important thing

701
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,340
this is where you need to learn so JVM

702
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,770
is divided in two or memory within the

703
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,050
JVM is divided into multiple parts and

704
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,620
two broad parts which is called as heap

705
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,440
and heap is nothing but collection of

706
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,430
young generation and old generation ways

707
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,560
another one is permanent germination

708
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,720
which is for other purpose and we'll

709
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,420
cover that in a minute what these are if

710
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,700
you look at the below diagram below that

711
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,920
younger generation is further divided

712
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,370
into three parts called Eden s 0 which

713
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:53,750
is survivor 0 and survivor 1 and things

714
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,990
as name suggests if and we'll cover that

715
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,600
in a minute as well so there are two

716
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,880
main areas one is called as permanent

717
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,910
generation which is used by JVM so JVM

718
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,650
internally uses a metadata and some

719
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,870
files so permanent generation is

720
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:13,040
reserved for that so if you have lot of

721
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,260
program if you have a big memory big

722
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,720
application you may also need to tweak

723
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,960
the perm size or maximum size as well

724
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,000
but this is permanent this is not where

725
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,520
your objects live this is not very of

726
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,560
program object lives this is the program

727
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,630
which is reserved by JVM and this is

728
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,150
where the permanent space or metadata of

729
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,970
Java classes being exist heap is

730
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,770
actually the area which is young plus

731
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,200
all generate old generation and this is

732
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,630
where the objects which your program

733
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,670
uses or the business logic uses or

734
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,800
ebusiness suite uses or any custom

735
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,200
application uses they need to they need

736
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,420
a space they use it from heap which is

737
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,750
young plus old generation making sense

738
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:58,210
so so collection of XML

739
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:04,270
Plus or so XMS is the Eden plus survival

740
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,630
zero propels survival one and and

741
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,790
tenured all this collection what you see

742
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,390
here from here XMS this is the area so

743
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,930
what you saw on earlier in one of the

744
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,920
diagrams of one of the screenshots here

745
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,620
or let me go back XMS yeah so this so

746
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,410
this means that your heap will begin

747
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,020
with 1 gig of memory and this is the

748
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,590
area which is here then it can grow up

749
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,320
to 1 0 to 4 it can grow up to so the in

750
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,450
disk in our case that means these two

751
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,120
areas are saying my minimum and maximum

752
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,760
are same for heap

753
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,740
similarly palm-sized this is here so my

754
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,140
palm size it started with 128 MB I can

755
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:57,130
grow up to 384 MB so now when you resize

756
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,190
this permanent jump pummelled generation

757
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,930
size and if you resize it quite often

758
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,880
it's an expensive affair it takes a lot

759
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,850
of time to resize or it impacts your

760
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,620
performance so if you have a bigger

761
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,240
application if you have a application

762
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,100
which is memory hungry like some

763
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,480
applications within e-business suite

764
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,150
it's always good practice to keep pump

765
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:19,210
size same as maximum size so that your

766
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,360
CPU or your JVM doesn't spend time in

767
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,900
changing these spaces also as I said

768
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,460
young generation is further divided into

769
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,800
two parts and in answer to server as

770
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,440
five spaces so what happens when a new

771
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,740
object so when when you when you access

772
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,940
something or when your application

773
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,370
access something and they need a space

774
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,600
or they need to bring some data from in

775
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,580
the code from the database or some other

776
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,940
place into the memory of the GBM the

777
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,610
data first comes or that those object

778
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,610
comes into the Aden area and over a

779
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,610
period of time then something happens

780
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,260
and what that something is called as

781
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,210
garbage collection which I'm going to

782
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,830
cover that in a minute

783
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,400
so then the Aden space is full or at a

784
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,710
particular regular interval there is

785
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,420
program called garbage collection and

786
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,880
when the garbage collection is

787
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,940
then our scenarios in which garbage

788
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,469
collection in Iran is when there's not

789
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:21,940
enough space and JVM needs memory to do

790
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,210
more code so garbage collection is run

791
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,040
so let's look at garbage collection what

792
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,870
is garbage collection guys am I making

793
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,699
sense just give me a thumbs up or thumbs

794
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,679
down or let me know and give me a little

795
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,239
hearts as well is it making sense what

796
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,219
is garbage collection what is the

797
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:38,050
previous slide that we covered here I'll

798
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,710
take a sip of water

799
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:56,760
okay let me take hi MA Jean welcome here

800
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,750
thank you very much guys for these

801
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,359
little hearts thank you very much and

802
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,369
these means a lot to me this inspired me

803
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:05,589
to do a more and more so and also if you

804
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:07,329
like this don't forget to share with

805
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:08,849
your colleagues and friends as well I

806
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:11,170
used to sing don't know about palm-sized

807
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,569
and XM s don't worry we'll go back to

808
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,010
this slide one more time I don't know

809
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,380
and palm-sized is where the WebLogic

810
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,819
class package are loaded absolutely

811
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,349
unfamiliar with optimal tuning for the

812
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:26,680
different servers in JVM and you so this

813
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,230
is where palm-sized is where you have

814
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,720
the metadata of the class metadata of

815
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,319
the class

816
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:37,630
not exactly the yeah okay so coming back

817
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,250
to garbage collection and this is very

818
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,800
important this is where a lot of tuning

819
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,089
especially with the memory hungry

820
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:44,770
application so garbage collection is

821
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,020
nothing but process of looking at

822
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,150
objects in heap and we told you earlier

823
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,069
what is heap heap was nothing but old

824
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:53,079
generation and new generation or young

825
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,260
generation in the old generation area so

826
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,270
process of looking at the heap objecting

827
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,990
here and deleting the unused one so if

828
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,950
any spit any object is no more you in

829
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,650
use then deleted to clear some space and

830
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,349
there are two type of GCS or garbage

831
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:13,119
collection we call some one is called as

832
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,240
- GC and second is called as major GC

833
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,059
now when a young generation fills up a

834
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:21,730
minor GC is kicked in so I told you

835
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,559
earlier what is young generation the

836
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:25,390
area space you see on the left hand side

837
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:30,549
which is new sighs sorry the area which

838
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:36,760
is some part of of the heap so when that

839
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,640
fills up then minor GC kicks in and what

840
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,290
happens when minor thing - GC kicks in

841
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:44,140
the application threads stop application

842
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,230
Hanks or halts comes to a halt for that

843
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,410
GC to finish so we call it stop the

844
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,710
world event it stops everything so

845
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,510
imagine you are in middle of if

846
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,520
application is running doing something

847
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,950
and the minor G C comes application will

848
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,109
come to a halt but your

849
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:04,450
objective should be to keep that GC of

850
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,420
finish as quickly as possible then

851
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,099
there's a another one which is major GC

852
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:11,619
which cleans up unused objects in the

853
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:14,079
old generation area

854
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,309
so major GC also like young like minor

855
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:23,529
GC stop applications and it basically

856
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:26,799
also stops applications so objective

857
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:29,339
should be to minimize that time

858
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:32,769
application works or spends on running a

859
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:35,380
major GC and ideally try to be keep it

860
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,339
between three to five seconds yeah

861
00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:42,509
so now GC can be of type serial parallel

862
00:37:42,509 --> 00:37:45,009
CMS and g1 I'm not going to go into

863
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:46,509
detail here but if you want further

864
00:37:46,509 --> 00:37:48,460
detail leave a comment I'm going to give

865
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,200
you the references on where you can read

866
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,440
further again we cover in one of the

867
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,089
other performance tuning our training on

868
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:57,249
for ab CBS as well as on WebLogic these

869
00:37:57,249 --> 00:38:01,989
these go in detail ok so what now if you

870
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:03,400
are working on a performance issue what

871
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,529
your objective should be to you the time

872
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:08,739
spend in GC to be at least or minimum or

873
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:12,190
less than 5% of execution type of the

874
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:16,420
full JVM also the Jeep JVM heap size did

875
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,359
determine so the heap size of the JVM

876
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,920
which is collection of young and old

877
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,950
generation that determines how long and

878
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:28,299
how often the GC should run also if

879
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:31,299
there is a large heap full GC is going

880
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:35,589
to be slower but it's going to be less

881
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:39,369
frequent so the size if you if you make

882
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:41,230
it too big it it's going to be slower

883
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,509
the GC is going to take longer but it it

884
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:47,650
will be less frequent so what happens if

885
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,739
GC is full and after sorry if the JVM

886
00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:53,049
heap is full and even even after running

887
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:55,509
garbage collection it can't find any

888
00:38:55,509 --> 00:38:58,569
space and all the objects aren't in use

889
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,970
that's when you get errors like

890
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,589
java.lang out of memory error you might

891
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:04,599
have seen a lot of these Java lying out

892
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:10,059
of memory errors as well then if you

893
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:12,160
want to see how much time is being spent

894
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,060
by the application

895
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,750
or the JVM in order for the GC or during

896
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,550
the GC time then you can meet there's an

897
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,120
option in when you start the GBM so this

898
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,430
like this here you put one more option

899
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,470
here in one of the environment variables

900
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,220
and you put - verbose GC to find out how

901
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,200
much time is being spent on GC so this

902
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,270
is how you do so this is just a nutshell

903
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,550
about just to do a quick recap before I

904
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,110
take one or two questions and we'll move

905
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,690
on so JVM there are two main areas palm

906
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,350
gen and heap and heap is young plus old

907
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,960
generation there's a within young

908
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,610
generation this is a Eden and two

909
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,740
survivors so basically the objects move

910
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,600
from one survivor to another survival

911
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,270
before and still ye being used then they

912
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,340
go to the old generation as the cleanup

913
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,890
words garbage collection process of

914
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,100
cleaning up the unused objects there are

915
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,610
two type minor and major and objective

916
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,670
should be to minimize the JVM time spent

917
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,540
in in running the GC and else otherwise

918
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,450
you might get out of memory errors so

919
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,670
before we move on to the next one let's

920
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,350
look at one or two questions and then

921
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:24,110
I'll move on to are you guys

922
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:27,380
understanding learning getting value on

923
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,860
that let me see okay good thanks give me

924
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,900
a little Hertz and tell me you're

925
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,090
enjoying this session or not I can see a

926
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,430
lot of you guys here when GC runs user

927
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,020
will be terminated from application no

928
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,630
user will not be terminated user will

929
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,330
continue it just they might see some

930
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,460
short a certain performance hits in

931
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,730
terms of it might be it might wait for a

932
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,620
few seconds or you might see or

933
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,760
everything frozen

934
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,560
that's how but user will never be

935
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,970
terminated or user will not terminate

936
00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:00,050
from here okay let's move on so what is

937
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:03,320
so what is heap dump you will hear that

938
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,780
word coming again and again the guys are

939
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,520
saying oh can you do the heap dump so

940
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,000
heap dump is nothing but process of

941
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,860
dumping the entire memory allocation

942
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,320
within a JVM whatever is going on right

943
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,300
now with the JVM you dump that that's

944
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,780
called as heap dump so you are going to

945
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,180
do heap dump analysis mainly when you

946
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,030
get out of memory errors or memory leak

947
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:26,990
in the application

948
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,610
how you're going to identify whether the

949
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,260
same memory leak or if it's out of

950
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,150
memory issue you will see in the log

951
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,430
file is out of memory or if you increase

952
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,080
the memory and again and again you are

953
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,730
seeing out of memory so let's suppose

954
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,619
you have increased from one get two to

955
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:41,030
being and you still get out of memory

956
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,860
error that means hey that means there is

957
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:47,210
a memory leak and so you dump that heap

958
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,950
dump and it'll tell you or it will give

959
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,510
you a hint whether there's a memory leak

960
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,310
or not

961
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:55,369
so heap dump is different from thread

962
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:57,410
dump again another important thing don't

963
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,450
makes heap dump is for memory thread

964
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,250
dump is for thread and we'll see that in

965
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,570
a minute so how you can take the heap

966
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:05,869
dump

967
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:08,240
there are various parameters and one of

968
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,920
the parameter you can add it in with in

969
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,560
GBM start up and you say xxxx heap dump

970
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,440
on out of memory and then you say heap

971
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,330
dump path and you specify where should

972
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,210
it generate that file so you put that

973
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:24,770
and so you can do it so on on the

974
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,140
startup in an environment variable so

975
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,940
when it does and any out of memory

976
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,940
happens the heap dump will be

977
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,550
automatically on the time or you can use

978
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,770
an application like third party or

979
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,650
external part or tool like J map or also

980
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,210
there's a another one which is Jake on

981
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,980
so these are gray or graphical user

982
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,670
interface so once it's dump is done you

983
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,650
need to read it and how you route read

984
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,330
again there are tools like Eclipse

985
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,850
memory analyzer or J hat or IBM or IBM

986
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,710
heap analyzer again good point in

987
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,760
e-business suite if you're hitting

988
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,619
problem like ebusiness suite because

989
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:59,980
it's commercially of the self

990
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,910
application you don't need to worry

991
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,100
about it you give it to a business suite

992
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,840
or the product support team

993
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,369
they will look out look it for you

994
00:43:07,369 --> 00:43:09,800
however if you develop your custom

995
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,150
application on top of ebusiness suite

996
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,980
then you might have to look at this

997
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,510
application again give it to the

998
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,980
developer they might they will give you

999
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,430
a hint

1000
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,089
or they will tell you

1001
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,990
okay then there is a next one as I said

1002
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,990
is javis tech trees and threat dump

1003
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,730
again thread dump is different from a

1004
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,650
stack trace and also thread up is

1005
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:33,520
different from heap dump so state trees

1006
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,680
is it's nothing but a user-friendly

1007
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,160
snapshot of threads which monitors and

1008
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,040
including monitors in JVM so JVM has

1009
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,309
threads and monitors so the snapshot of

1010
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:48,250
of that at any given point in time is

1011
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,349
called a stack trace it helps in

1012
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:53,109
troubleshooting hanging or spinning java

1013
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:54,579
applications so some of you guys were

1014
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:57,430
saying oh my application hangs or taking

1015
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,260
longer than it should or sometimes we

1016
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,540
notice that performance issue or my J my

1017
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:06,369
JVM or my processes reach 200% CPU so in

1018
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:08,170
that case you should run Java stack

1019
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,990
trace similarly sometimes you will get a

1020
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,849
warning state in application says and

1021
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:16,270
this tie back to the error everything we

1022
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,799
are discussing about is the error from

1023
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:20,440
the webinar that we discussed at the

1024
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,450
start so what happens there's a thread

1025
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,690
dump so if there are stuck threads then

1026
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,549
you might want to do read dump which is

1027
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:29,740
nothing but snapshot of all the threads

1028
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,470
in the application at that point now

1029
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,980
stack trip sorry it's a typo it's a

1030
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,750
stack trace will not show memory

1031
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,369
distribution for memory if you're in

1032
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:40,990
memory you need to go back to the heap

1033
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:44,680
dump if you want ten dump or stack trace

1034
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,410
then you pick it here now again how do

1035
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,619
you create a stack trace you run you

1036
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:54,849
simply say kill as you signal quit

1037
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:56,890
signal to the JVM so you need to find

1038
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,599
out what is the JVM how do you find out

1039
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,299
GBM again you do psu X and now if you

1040
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:04,299
see here on this here screen update PSU

1041
00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:07,270
X and grab for Java and I found out

1042
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,770
let's suppose I need to find out J

1043
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:11,380
process ID for JV of form server I'll

1044
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,619
simply do that and six six four four is

1045
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:17,829
to the process ID so once I know the

1046
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:19,630
process ID I'll simply is a kill - three

1047
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,329
and process ID and there are one or two

1048
00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:24,040
different type of kill as well you can

1049
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,750
even do that now output will be written

1050
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,119
in ASCII format and simply use any

1051
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,150
format like editor or

1052
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:37,660
VI or notepad to open that stake trace

1053
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,720
or third um okay so just to do a quick

1054
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,810
recap on what we looked at so we said

1055
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,700
there is a heap dump which is the dump

1056
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,160
of memory there is a set dump which is a

1057
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,470
dump of thread at that point in JVM

1058
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:54,609
stack trace which is a snapshot of

1059
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:58,510
threads as well as monitors in JVM so

1060
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,340
coming back to the main question

1061
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,380
oh I'm hitting this problem how should I

1062
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,960
troubleshoot so now first of all if

1063
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,180
there's a warning you need to look into

1064
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,930
the application log file so that warning

1065
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,910
could be for multiple reasons so make

1066
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:14,680
sure you look at the managed server log

1067
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,099
file

1068
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:17,560
now first you to find out and where

1069
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,510
these log files will be visible give me

1070
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,440
one second guys so let me swap my screen

1071
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,590
and let me take one any question is

1072
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,950
there's no question no oh okay so there

1073
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,810
is a question from Mozilla saying my

1074
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,970
report server is hanging very often

1075
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,690
often so first of all there are some

1076
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,310
magic if you are your report server is

1077
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,750
hanging first of all which version of

1078
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,869
e-business suite you are working on also

1079
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:47,290
check that are there any performance

1080
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,020
patches available because Oracle

1081
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,990
e-business suite team gives you a

1082
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:54,580
performance patches are quite regularly

1083
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,349
so make sure you have those performance

1084
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:59,859
patches or not but if you tell a little

1085
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,119
bit more detail in terms of which

1086
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,859
ebusiness suite version it is what path

1087
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:05,260
sets you have we should be able to add a

1088
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,540
little bit or give a little bit more

1089
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,000
value or such on my Oracle support there

1090
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,500
are performance patches of way available

1091
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,839
for reports which should not is saying

1092
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,490
some of us missed the session can we

1093
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,440
have the presentation public so that we

1094
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,630
can download and go through so don't

1095
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:21,550
worry you watch the replay so replay

1096
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:22,900
will be available on the same page which

1097
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,240
is Katun academy.com first eby's flour

1098
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,599
0eb is sorry cloud-like 13k toning

1099
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:30,790
academy.com ford slash cloud-like 13

1100
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,770
which not go back to that and and ask

1101
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,040
again so let me hold on let me see the

1102
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,700
whatever stock yeah so let me swap okay

1103
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,080
so this is what I was talking about

1104
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,720
right now state is running shutdown

1105
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,320
running running running so I have 4 J 5

1106
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,800
J

1107
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,110
I'm running and one is down and here if

1108
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,880
there's any problem you will see warning

1109
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,350
here so he will see his status as a

1110
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:54,940
warning and if you're in a situation

1111
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,460
like that look at make a note of which

1112
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,490
application it is and then look at sorry

1113
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,970
which man is over is this oayk or here

1114
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,840
so the ones will you know the

1115
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,760
application then you go to the oayk or

1116
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,770
managed server log file so where are

1117
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,990
those log files we told you that it will

1118
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:14,350
be under domain home so right now we

1119
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,200
this is my domain home inside inside

1120
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,990
that I'll go to servers an inside server

1121
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,820
I'll go to the appropriate server in

1122
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,290
which where I'm hitting this performance

1123
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,420
problem or the warning so I'll go to way

1124
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,080
code and then logs and within logs do LS

1125
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,590
- ltr' and this should be out file and

1126
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:34,000
this should be a diagnostic file so

1127
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,410
these are the two files you should focus

1128
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:38,860
out and diagnostic so in out file most

1129
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,300
probably it will be in if it's out of

1130
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,490
memory it will be in out file output

1131
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:46,090
file and right now I don't think I'm

1132
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,600
hitting any problem no there's no error

1133
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,460
there's no memory error so otherwise you

1134
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,900
will get the warning here this is what

1135
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,650
you will see like so the warning could

1136
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,330
be for multiple reasons and you can't

1137
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,800
predict by telling oh I'm getting a

1138
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,930
warning it could be for multiple reasons

1139
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:04,960
so this question was asked by forgot

1140
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,640
name of the gentleman in the webinar so

1141
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,460
it could be JDBC connection issues so

1142
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,130
have a look at so what is JDBC I told

1143
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:15,040
you earlier that okay here this

1144
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,510
application needs to talk to the

1145
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:18,190
database or WebLogic needs to talk to

1146
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,780
the database and that database

1147
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:24,610
connectivity is is this JDBC connection

1148
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:29,010
issue one so if you see error like Oh

1149
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:31,690
pool connection Oracle GBPC driver if

1150
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:32,950
you see something like that that means

1151
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:36,670
it's a JDBC issue or you can see stuck

1152
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,980
thread so other application will tell

1153
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,170
here stuck threads so you will see the

1154
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,360
message as stuck thread so you click or

1155
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,250
you do the thread dump and thread dump

1156
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,370
you will you see which where exactly the

1157
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:50,560
stuck thread is waiting on again there

1158
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,560
are lot of known issues with respect to

1159
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,570
e business suite so make sure you have

1160
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,250
all the performance patches applicable

1161
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:01,420
on that so this is this was

1162
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,730
one question and as I said if you want

1163
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,220
to watch all other questions which have

1164
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,540
answered in the webinar if you have to

1165
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,310
go through the WebLogic 12c

1166
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,440
multi-tenancy micro container partitions

1167
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,480
again the replays available on Titan

1168
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,270
Academy Comfort / web-browsing 0 - again

1169
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,620
we are not going to keep this replay for

1170
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,930
long and so I'm going to take few more

1171
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,580
one more questions and see if there's

1172
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,430
any question but there were a lot of

1173
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,200
other questions being asked and I think

1174
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,850
looking at the time I didn't expect that

1175
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:29,980
it's going to take that too long so I'll

1176
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,930
I probably should view this remaining

1177
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:33,940
questions in our private Facebook group

1178
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,710
and I will tell you what that group is

1179
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:36,940
will be discussed there so remaining

1180
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,020
questions I'm going to take it in

1181
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,270
private Facebook group so Dave jeath and

1182
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,310
green that asks the same question what

1183
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,770
if host one hosting the admin server

1184
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,960
crashes so I'll quickly tell you that

1185
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,090
admin server is a singleton service

1186
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:52,120
which can run only on one node so what

1187
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,890
if that node goes down how do we

1188
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,350
failover how do the admin server is

1189
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:58,240
going to work what what is going to

1190
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,770
happen with remaining manage servers

1191
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,840
what will happen to the classified min

1192
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,210
server goes down and we also looked at

1193
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:06,790
the clustering in the webinar which is

1194
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,710
horizontal versus vertical clustering

1195
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:11,560
then there was a concept we discussed

1196
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,690
about virtual IP and where is it used

1197
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,760
what should I be any in admin server

1198
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,890
also how does admin server

1199
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,530
high-availability works there's also a

1200
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:22,240
question from vedanta bout certification

1201
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,640
when is there a certification for web

1202
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,410
logic or not so there are certification

1203
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,210
I'm going to tell a little bit more in

1204
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,790
detail there's a question from Syed

1205
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:33,070
Sahib sameen can I configure a load

1206
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:36,880
balancer between the WebLogic and HTTP

1207
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,340
server sorry WebLogic and end-user so

1208
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,710
this is the architecture which said you

1209
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,140
have users going from the firewall to

1210
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,090
the load balancer to the web server to

1211
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:47,350
the WebLogic

1212
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,990
so this is the on right hand side yes

1213
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,540
few users load balancer HTTP server and

1214
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,700
web logic so the question was is that

1215
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,000
Oracle HTTP server or OTD also we

1216
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,440
discussed in the webinar is that

1217
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,410
mandatory so that question again I'm

1218
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,990
going to pick that also if you're

1219
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,850
putting load balancer what is Oracle's

1220
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,740
recommendations for these load balancers

1221
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,740
so as I said go and have a look at it

1222
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:15,230
WebLogic zero two and salumi Dean also

1223
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,700
how to connect to the JDBC or data

1224
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,040
sources what is Gridlink what is multi

1225
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,800
data source so this is also supposed to

1226
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,750
cover which is how do you connect to the

1227
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:27,590
database what the JDBC sees so I'm going

1228
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:29,000
to discuss this all this in this

1229
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,100
community which is catered in

1230
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,010
academy.com /join FB if you're not part

1231
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,290
of this I would highly recommend you to

1232
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:38,770
be part of this be part of this

1233
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:41,840
community I'm going to cover that apart

1234
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,330
from that we also have a worship group

1235
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,250
it's what we have a separate whatsapp

1236
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,230
group for paid members this is for free

1237
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:50,000
members if you want to discuss and

1238
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,970
communicate Kate Undine academy.com

1239
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:56,270
/what self also if you're a DBA I would

1240
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,420
love you to be if you're a DBA or

1241
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,050
interested in cloud either DBA or cloud

1242
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:06,500
we are doing a free live webinar on this

1243
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,500
Saturday which is on 12th where 12th of

1244
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,290
May we were able to cover everything

1245
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,359
like why you learn cloud what is cloud

1246
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:15,890
computing what is the cloud service

1247
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,920
models SAS pass idlest what are the

1248
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,590
cloud deployment models then be able to

1249
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,359
look at how do you build your first

1250
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,000
Oracle database on cloud not in

1251
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,160
infrastructure and service but in plate

1252
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,830
formatted service how do can you create

1253
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:34,100
it under 10 minutes or so or everything

1254
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,970
up and running within 30 minutes then 12

1255
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:39,320
point checklist to go from complete

1256
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,270
beginner to expert if you're a DBA

1257
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:43,280
you'll get tons of value if you're not a

1258
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,859
DBA you will still learn but focused on

1259
00:53:45,859 --> 00:53:48,080
cloud so the URL is ketone academy.com

1260
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,869
