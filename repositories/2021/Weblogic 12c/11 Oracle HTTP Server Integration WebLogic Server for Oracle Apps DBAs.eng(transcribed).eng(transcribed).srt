1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,469
hi everyone again so in the previous

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,679
video I covered theory part on what is

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,350
Oracle HTTP server and WebLogic

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,350
integration look like and we looked at

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,070
modern score WL underscore OHS in this

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,350
video I'm going to cover or do a

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,599
hands-on on witches WebLogic server

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,179
integration so let's jump on to the

9
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,640
server first I'm going to first look at

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,130
the browser on where I'll be accessing

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,280
an Oracle HTTP server page and WebLogic

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,390
server URL and then we'll configure on

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,660
the server integration between OHS and

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,910
web logic and then finally access those

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,180
configuration on the browser so let's

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,180
jump on to the server now so if you look

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,940
at the server i'm currently connecting

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,070
to the browser and i'm trying to access

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,000
first the oracle HTTP server page which

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,450
is IM dot k 21 technologies comm forward

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,360
slash seven seven seven seven this is

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,750
where my Oracle HTTP server is running

23
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,640
so this is showing that this an Oracle

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,310
HTTP server page and if I type forward

25
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,590
slash console since there is nothing

26
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,110
configured it's saying or there's no

27
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,390
forward slash console configured I'm

28
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,360
getting the requested URL not found so

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,360
if I look at the server right now so

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,310
because I'm accessing forceless console

31
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,560
the entry should come into the access

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,320
log so let's look at in my server the

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,259
diagnostic log so if I go to the

34
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,960
diagnostics and then logs and then OHS

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,720
which is one so we covered in one of our

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,450
previous videos the log file and

37
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,320
configuration file so if I'm doing tale

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,829
minus F on access log so X is log is the

39
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,430
file in which any request that goes to

40
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,860
the Oracle HTTP server are recorded so

41
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,889
the location is this is my Oracle

42
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,890
instance then you have Diagnostics

43
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,230
logs OHS and OHS one so I'm doing tail -

44
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,210
F and access log and where I cried

45
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,510
accessing console so let's put few

46
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,880
enters here and then forwards less

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,230
console and I get console so it says

48
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,720
it's coming from this IP this is my

49
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,360
client IP this is the date on which I

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,300
have attempted this the method of

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,670
accessing this page is get so there's a

52
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,580
get and post and head so it's a get

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,300
forward slash console and 404 is the

54
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,290
HTTP code which is page not found and

55
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,830
190 is the I think it's a byte or size

56
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,640
so this page is not found now I start

57
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,320
another one and then this time I type

58
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,120
but seven thousand one which is my

59
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,920
WebLogic console that's where my

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,440
WebLogic console is running and I can

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,420
access this console next I'm going to do

62
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,940
is I'm going to configure that so that

63
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,390
this forms less console from my HTTP

64
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,850
server is also accessible so that I

65
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,709
don't have to go to seven thousand one

66
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,200
port or the WebLogic server so in order

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,940
to achieve that I'll first go to my

68
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,980
configuration folder where my

69
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,549
configurations are for mod WL OHS that's

70
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,180
under Oracle instance which is this

71
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,390
folder and then config and then OHS

72
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,620
which is one and this is the file which

73
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,120
I'm going to modify so I'll take a

74
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,670
backup of this file mod WL underscore

75
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,709
witch's sorry this mod underscore WL OHS

76
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,360
underscore conf underscore re and I'll

77
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,970
do open up more WL which is conf and I

78
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,269
will say uncomment this and uncomment

79
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,000
this and here I am going to change the

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,130
host team my host name where WebLogic is

81
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,110
running is I am dot k21

82
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,420
technologies dot-com and the port number

83
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,710
is 7,001 I'll come in from here this

84
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,980
forward slash remove this and I'll leave

85
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:45,480
path cream or so I'll say opium in CTL

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,090
stop all to stop my Oracle HTTP server

87
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,470
and I'll do then do Oracle opium in CTL

88
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,660
start all so in order for this

89
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,720
configuration to take into effect I need

90
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,169
to restart my Oracle HTTP server so that

91
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:04,080
the updated mod WOL OHS comes into

92
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,960
effect ok so that didn't work and I

93
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,970
think I know the reason I should have

94
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,010
changed here instead of WebLogic should

95
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,919
have been console so the reason is I did

96
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,160
a typo here so to be console let's stop

97
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,360
or restart the Oracle HTTP server again

98
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,520
so I'm starting the server again so now

99
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,650
restarted the Oracle HTTP server with

100
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,590
the correct entry and now let's look at

101
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,919
the Oracle so now if you see it's seven

102
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,590
seven seven seven forward slash console

103
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,960
and I'm still able to access the same

104
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,050
console for WebLogic through Oracle HTTP

105
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,510
server so I'll enter now username

106
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,860
WebLogic and password as welcome one or

107
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,390
the password that is for the blodge ik

108
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,930
and I can access this I am dot K 21

109
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,990
technologies comm four slash console now

110
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,390
this is seven seven seven seven which is

111
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,150
the Oracle HTTP listener port and this

112
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,430
is what it's configured now now some

113
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,010
applications expect you to have the

114
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,470
plug-in enabled and this is that

115
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,360
configuration which I earlier showed

116
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,650
into the video so you go to the advanced

117
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,180
and you say WebLogic plug-in enabled so

118
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,910
this parameter specifies of the weather

119
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,150
server uses WL proxy client IP header

120
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,280
which is recommended if server instance

121
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,350
will receive requests from plug c plugin

122
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,080
yeah so this is a recommended setting

123
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,840
sometime allah console will work but

124
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,800
there are a lot of a plane

125
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,930
occasions which don't work if you don't

126
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,500
have this plug-in selected so you select

127
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,379
the plug-in for on to the server in our

128
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,169
case we have enabled on admin server but

129
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:54,930
you go and change it on the respective

130
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,870
server to which your forwarding request

131
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,479
from Oracle HTTP server so let's suppose

132
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,789
I'm configuring to so I inflow from my

133
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,710
study B server I'll go to the sewer

134
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,379
manage server under advanced and I'll

135
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,340
enable this HTTP or plug-in which is

136
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,909
this WebLogic plug-in enable this so

137
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:17,909
this completes the hand-sewn on how to

138
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:20,460
configure Oracle HTTP server as a

139
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,430
reverse proxy for application or for

140
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,830
WebLogic server and that we are going to

141
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,949
use quite actively in our Oracle Fusion

142
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,560
Middleware so just to recap on in this

143
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,009
video we looked at how to configure

144
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,229
Oracle HTTP server as a reverse proxy

145
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,259
for WebLogic server where we modified

146
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,979
mod underscore WL underscore OHS conf to

147
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,520
include or forward any request coming to

148
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,580
forward slash console to HTTP server to

149
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,819
the Oracle WebLogic server in the next

150
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,680
video we're going to look at how the

151
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,590
same configuration is configured on

152
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,889
Oracle EBS 12.2 so hit on to the next

153
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,380
video to look at the configuration

154
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,069
setting in Oracle EBS 12.2 for Oracle

155
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:10,949
HTTP server and how these configurations

156
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,560
are pointing applications deployed on

157
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,550
Oracle WebLogic domain for EBS 12.2

158
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,430
you
