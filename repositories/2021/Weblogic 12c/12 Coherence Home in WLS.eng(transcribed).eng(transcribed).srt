00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,389
hi everyone my name is Otto Kumar and in

2
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:10,679
this section we are going to look at

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,370
question answer related to this module

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,410
so the first question which is from saya

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,859
is related to Oracle Fusion Middleware

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,220
homes and the question is what is

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,609
coherence home so if you have not looked

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,880
at the various homes in Oracle Fusion

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,880
Middleware have a look at that first in

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,750
that video there I covered various homes

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,420
like WebLogic home Java home Oracle home

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,290
domain and instance home so similar to

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,829
those homes oracle coherence home is the

14
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,340
top-level directory under which

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,430
coherence related executables are stored

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,090
or the software is stored so coherence

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,640
is used in Oracle Fusion Middleware as a

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,930
caching software so it holds the data

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,070
cache and it also is being used in some

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,049
of the Oracle Fusion Middleware product

21
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,049
for clustering like Oracle access

22
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,530
manager Oracle so us wait so when you

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,900
install Oracle Fusion Middleware use

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,049
install Oracle WebLogic installer with

25
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,360
coherence let me take you to the server

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,759
while installing WebLogic and when

27
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,740
you're installing WebLogic you will get

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,170
an option to install coherence and you

29
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,509
select installer of WebLogic with

30
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,250
coherence so let's go on to the server

31
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,720
so if you look at now I am on server and

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,329
I'm starting the installation of AB

33
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,460
logic server using Java

34
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,840
- jar WLS 10:36 generic jar this is also

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,689
covered in our web logic module where we

36
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,970
say installation of AB logic so hit

37
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,610
enter and on one of the screen you will

38
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,250
notice that it's prompting for coherence

39
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,770
home so if you notice here it says

40
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,079
choose install type and I have a typical

41
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,538
where I have WebLogic server and oracle

42
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,440
coherence so since I have

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,330
used an installer WebLogic installer

44
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,670
that has both WebLogic as well as oracle

45
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,040
coherence that's why I'm getting this

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,440
option so in Oracle Fusion Middleware

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,320
products for installing components like

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,210
sewer OB ie WebCenter

49
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,220
identity and access management software

50
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,650
like Oracle access manager or Identity

51
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,980
Manager you should use coherence so when

52
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,440
you select this it is going to create a

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,660
directory so let me cancel this I

54
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,940
already have an installation which I'm

55
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,960
going to show you so go to you 0 1 app

56
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,740
Oracle fmw underscore sewer and inside

57
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,480
that I have this directory coherence

58
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,410
underscore 3.7 so this is my coherence

59
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,640
home so the Goron's home is till here

60
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,370
which is you 0 1 app Oracle fmw

61
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,020
underscore so our coherence underscore

62
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,010
3.7 so the oracle coherence says top

63
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,400
level directory in which coherence

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,700
software is configured installed and

65
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,860
configured in your Oracle Fusion

66
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,850
Middleware environment

67
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,290
thanks a it for asking this question
